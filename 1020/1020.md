INDEX produces a cross reference listing, directories of statements,
etc. for FORTRAN source programs.


The source code, plus a line number for each FORTRAN statement is
listed for each program. A directory is produced for each program,
cross referencing all statement number, variable subroutines,
functions parameters, procedures, and name lists used. The symbols
used in each program are listed in numeric and alphabetic order with
references to the FORTRAN line numbers on which they occur. At
termination, a final index is generated showing all symbols and the
names of the programs in which they are referenced.
