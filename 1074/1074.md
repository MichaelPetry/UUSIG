This package contains two MAPPER systems: 1) File Manager System.
MAPPER based EXEC file management system which consolidates all EXEC
files, based upon qualifiers, that users are responsible for into two
rids: one for cataloged files, one for archived files. User can
monitor existence of files, delete, sym, restore, or archive files
with system. Uses MFD for identifying files and FAS for file

the archival of MAPPER rids to tape. User can request archive,
