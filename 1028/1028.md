<font color="#AF0000">DCTNRY</font> reads FORTRAN elements and makes
a listing of all the variables and the way they are used. This
listing can be quite helpful in finding out where variables were
changed or used in computations within a program. The list of output
from <font color="#AF0000">DCTNRY</font> includes:


   
- A table of all the alphanumeric names (variables, subroutines,
       functions, etc.) used in a set of FORTRAN source statements.
    
       
- A table of all statement numbers and a table of all transfer
       statements used in a set of FORTRAN source elements.
    
       
- A list of numbers after each entry in each table to indicate
       on which lines the entry appears.
    
       
- A list of flags following each entry and each line number to
       indicate the type of entry and how the entry is used (flags are
       explained in the table in which they appear).
    
       
- The name of the COMMON block containing a specified variable
       name in the error flag field of that variable name.
