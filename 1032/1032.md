<font color="#AF0000">LISP</font> is a programming language designed
primarily for processing symbolic data. It has been used for symbolic
calculations in differential and integral calculus, electrical
circuit theory, mathematical logic, game playing and other fields of
artificial intelligence. <font color="#AF0000">LISP</font> differs
from most programming languages in three important ways:


   
- All data in the form of symbolic expressions is usually
       referred to as S-expressions. S-expressions are of indefinite
       length and have a branching tree type of structure, so that
       significant sub-expressions can be readily isolated.
    
       
- The source language specifies in what way the S-expressions
       are to be processed. This consists of recursive functions of S-
       expressions.
    
       
- <font color="#AF0000">LISP</font> can interpret and execute
       programs written in the form of S- expressions. Thus, unlike most
       higher level languages, it can be used to generate programs for
       further execution.
