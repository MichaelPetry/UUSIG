This is the standard algorithm used on Unix ('.Z' files)


The original program was written and placed in the public domain
by: Spencer W. Thomas, Jim McKie, Steve Davies, Ken Turkowski, James
A. Woods and Joe Orost.


This program was based on version 4.0.


A-Series translation by Michael B. Smith (mbs@adastra.cvl.va.us)


If I would re-write this, I'd use the same input that the Unix
compress does, however, I'm not going to. So, I've got A-Series
things that define what we do.


File-equate STDIN to the file (I've only tested it against a
diskfile) to be read. STDOUT to the output file (which will be named
DATA/COMPRESS or DATA/UNCOMPRESS as appropriate).


SW1: DEBUG (a variety of debugging information)  
&#10;&#10;SW2: NOMAGIC (for compatibility with version 2.0 compress)  
&#10;&#10;SW3: COMPRESS (vs. decompress STDIN)  
&#10;&#10;SW8: STD_DEBUG (debug stdio routines)


So, the default action is to uncompress a file named STDIN to a
diskfile named DATA/UNCOMPRESS.


If SW3 is set, then compress a file named STDIN to a diskfile
named DATA/COMPRESS.


The algorithm is Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) similar to what is used in
the popular ZIP packages. Basically, it finds common substrings and
replaces them with a variable size code. This is deterministic and
done on-the-fly. Thus, the decompression routine needs no input
table, and instead tracks the way the table was built.


Algorithm documentation in "A Technique for High Performance Data
Compression", _IEEE_Computer_, Vol. 17, No. 6 (June 1984), pp. 8-19,
by Terry A. Welch.


This program was converted DIRECTLY from the 'C' source. FEW
A-Series optimizations have been done. The entire
compress/decompress/getcode/ outputc routines could be significantly
improved performance-wise to better use the strengths of the A-Series
(such as bit manipulation operators). Leaving it alone, however,
shows some of the interesting ways in which logical operations can be
used, and how simple it can be to move a Unix program to A-Series.
