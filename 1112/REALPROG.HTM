In Fact, real programmers can'teven spell quiche. They eat Twinkies, Szechwan &#91;sic&#93; food,and drink Pabst.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write specs -- users should considerthemselves lucky to get any programs that work at all -- and takewhat they get.</P><P>Real Programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard towrite, it should be hard to understand.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write application programs; they programright down on the bare metal. Application programming is foraccounting feebs who can't do systems programming.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write COBOL. COBOL is for wimpy applicationprogrammers.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for pipe stressfreaks and cyrstallography weenies.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write in BASIC. Actually, no programmerswrite in BASIC after the age of 12.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write in PL/1. PL/1 is for those twinks whocan't decide whether to write in FORTRAN or COBOL.</P><P>Real Programmers don't write in PASCAL, or BLISS, or ADA, or C, orany of those pinko computer science languages. Strong typing is forpeople with weak memories.</P><P>Real Programmers' programs never work right the first time. But ifreal programmers can get their supervisor to throw them on themachine and everyone else off, their programs can be patched intoworking in 'only a few' 30 hour debugging sessions.</P><P>Real Programmers don't document. Documentation is for simps whocan't read the listings or the object deck.</P><P>Real Programmers don't play tennis, or racket ball, or any othersport that requires them to change clothes. Mountain climbing is OK,and real programmers will wear their climbing boots to work in case amountain should suddenly spring up in the middle of the machineroom.</P><P>Real Programmers don't work 9 to 5. If any real programmers arearound at 9 AM, it's because they were there all night.</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
