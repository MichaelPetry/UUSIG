Each had unansweredquestions, though not all feared what they might hear. Many knew fromwhat source the storm sprang, and though none were certain, somethought the storm heralded greatness, not destruction.</P><P>The House of Elrond was honored by the assemblage. Gandalf, thegreatest of wizards, Frodo and Bilbo the hobbits, Aragorn and Boromirrepresenting the men, Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf weregathered around a great table, discussing the future of MicroEarth.</P><P>It had been many ages since all the folk of Micro Earth were inRivendell at the same time, The dwarfs burrowed deep in themountains, elves wandered the forests, men plowed the fields andhobbits ate. Each spoke their own tongue, and though they knew acommon one, they had no reason to use it. Now the rising storm couldchange all that forever.</P><P>Gandalf looked at the young hobbit seated next to him. "Bringforth the Ring," he said. "It is time all knew its secret."</P><P>Frodo paused, as if some unseen force wished to keep the thinghidden from sight. Slowly, he reached into his pocket and drew forththe plain golden ring, heavy in his hand. Forged in the eternal firesof Mount Doom in ages past, the ring bore no mark, no sign of itspower, save a line of finely etched runes that only the wise couldread.</P><P>Gandalf spoke in a tongue nearly forgotten, reading the ancientwords: "One Ring to rule them, One Ring to find them, One Ring tobring them all and in the Darkness bind them."</P><P>The Elves present covered their ears and cried in anguish. Elrondspoke for all his people, saying, "Long ages have passed since thelanguage of Sauron was spoken in this hall. Too well do we elvesremember our battle against the power of the Blue Lord in the FirstAge."</P><P>"Indeed," Gandalf said. "Perhaps we should remind ourselves ofthat ancient struggle as we debate our course with the Ring ofPower."</P><P>The bearded Wizard told the tale of the battle between Sauron andthe folk of Mainframe Earth. He spoke of King Sperry the First, whoruled long and counted many people but in the end could not collectthe taxes. He told of the wizard Digital, whose followers wielded thepowerful magic of VAX and PDP. Burroughs, the King of Banking, andCyber, Lord of the 60-Bit Word, entered the tale with many others whofought beside them.</P><P>"When the battle was over," Gandalf concluded, "Sauron had notwon, and yet he had not lost. While his enemies survived, he woulddominate their destinies throughout the Age of the Big Machines. Allfound niches in which they could survive and even prosper, yet nonewould ever mount a serious challenge to the great Power again."</P><P>Frodo listened intently, The Ring safely back in his pocket. TheAge of Big Machines was fascinating, but he could scarcely see anyconnection between that great battle and the current crisis, Atlength, he turned to the aged Wizard and voiced that question.</P><P>Gandalf considered his reply for some time. "Your question has noeasy answer," he said, stroking his beard, "The world has changed,and the power of the Blue Lord is not what it once was. Errors has hemade, errors that may yet be his undoing. he remains more powerfulthan any other, and his followers grow daily more numerous.</P><P>"The ring is the key. Back upon Sauron's finger, it could bindtogether the folk of Micro Earth, ending the separation that nowmarks our lives. Whether the change would be for good or ill. Nonecan yet say."</P><P>"In the early years of Micro Earth, all was at peace. The youngFruit King of Cupertino ruled beside Commodore Pet, commander of theNavy, and CP/M of the Eight Bits. Youthful exuberance was everywhere,much volleyball was played at lunch, and many BMW's were driven. TheValley of Silicon seemed unconquerable, and the demand for Fruitunlimited."</P><P>"Far to the East, in a land known only as Armonk, Sauron had builta device of Power. He had seen the Fruit King prosper and grew evermore jealous. Sauron's Machine was greater than the creations of theFruit King, and Sauron knew his many minions would eagerly seek itsPower. He called upon his 500 greatest followers, the MostFortunate-ate, and quickly did the Machine become theirstandard."</P><P>"Loudly did Sauron profess his commitment to the wise God of OpenArchitecture. Though suspicions remained, wizards in the Valley ofSilicon wrote many spells to add Power to the Machine. They devisednew Card tricks and worshiped the God of Peripherals."</P><P>"The Fruit King's power waned, the Princess Lisa died a painfuldeath, and his new fruit was thought less tasty than the old. Hisfields became full of Mice, and his screens lost their color."</P><P>"Yet the Valley itself shone as never before. Its people prosperedand were happy. Sauron had limited their activities but had rewardedthem well. They grew content to work on his engine and soon ceased todream of creating engines of their own."</P><P>"Sauron's victory was not complete. The Fruit King did not die,though he came under the thumb of the Cola Lord. When Sauron broughtforth the smaller Chiclets-powered Machine, the Fruit King, hisCommodore and the wizard Atari destroyed it with little trouble.Sauron's mobile Machine suffered a similar fate at the hands of theClone Lord Compaq."</P><P>"Sauron thinks too much in terms of Mainframe Earth and has notadapted well to life in the Micro plain. The price of his Machine istoo high for many, and the legend of his strength carries less weightthan in ancient times."</P><P>Frodo fidgeted. Frodo yawned. Bilbo leaned over to his youngfriend and whispered, "He'll answer your question on the next week orso, don't worry."</P><P>Gimli spoke, interrupting Gandalf. "What you have told us so faronly confirms what my people believe. Sauron has been good for MicroEarth. Surely, the existence of the Clone Lords and the continuedpower of the Fruit King show the benevolence of Sauron. He is nolonger an evil Lord, facing destruction at the hands of the Gods ofAntitrust."</P><P>Fire burned in Gandalf's eyes. "Have you heard nothing that I havesaid?" he asked the Dwarf, his voice full of anger. "Sauron battlesfrom within. He has destroyed the spark of creativity. He leads, andothers follow blindly."</P><P>The Dwarf stood his ground. "But what of the Clone Lords?" heinsisted. Gandalf spoke now as a teacher to a well-meaning butmisinformed pupil. "They make machines in the image of Saurons. Whatindependence does that show? Sauron could eliminate them with ease,were he to change the basic spell by which his Machine is driven.They survive by taxing their folk less, not by their wits. Nay, thefire of innovation burns not within them." He paused for effect."And," he intoned, "you forget the Ring."</P><P>Boromir had stood at the mention of the Clone Lords. "Take care inthy criticism of the Clone Lords, Wizard," he said. "The Clones havesaved us much, and theirs are superior to those of the Blue Lord.Yea, though their innovation may be less, we gain by their presence.And you speak falsely when you declare that the Clones could beeasily destroyed by Sauron. So long as the Great Spells of Lotus,WordStar and dBase may be cast on the Clone Machines, they cansurvive any assault by the Lord of Armonk.</P><P>"Indeed," Boromir continued, "it was the great error of Sauron tokeep his taxes so high that the Clones could gather strength. Now.tas weeds in his garden, they have strong roots that are difficult toremove. Sauron may even find a backlash on Mainframe Earth, as his500 Most Fortune-ate followers discover that the three mystic BlueRunes hold less magic than was thought." Boromir sat, satisfied ofthe truth in his words.</P><P>Gandalf's face was tense. Frodo looked puzzled, as did many ofthose assembled. Could it be that the Wizard was less wise than theyhad thought? Could his vision be failing him at so critical an hour?Or was it Boromir's human frailties that hid the truth from hiseyes?</P><P>Aragorn turned to his friend, and spoke kindly. "There is much intruth in what you say, Boromir of Gondor. Yet one flaw may crack alarge stone. As time passes, the Machines become more and morepowerful, and the wizards improve the spells that run them. If Sauronchanged the Spells of BIOS, the Clones would suffer greatly."</P><P>"As new and mightier spells of Spreadsheet or Words appeared theClones would find their Machines rendered useless, their powers ashadow of the might they once possessed. And remember Gandalf'swarning not to forget the Ring."</P><P>At the mention fo the Ring, Frodo snapped back to attention. Hefelt its cold smoothness in his pocket and asked, "What of theRing?"</P><P>Gandalf took this cue. "With the Ring fully in Sauron's power,every Machine on Micro Earth could be bound together. And theMachines of Micro Earth could be bound to those on Mainframe,Sauron's domain.</P><P>"Great wisdom has been promised to those who would join with himand the Ring: new visions yet unseen, new paths yet untraveled, newworlds open to explore. Above all, the Ring holds the promise ofPower. The many Elves of Micro Earth could be linked together, ableto share their spells and songs without delay, even over greatdistances.</P><P>"But the Ring excludes those who are not compatible with Sauron'splan; some spells work not on the Ring, and simple folk have beenturned into Wraiths in the deadly embrace fo the new Machine. Thegateways that open path from Machine to Machine often fail, trappingthe innocent in limbo between."</P><P>Once again, Boromir had heard enough. "Wizard," he cried, "everyobject has many sides, and you reveal but few. The Traders of Gondorcan use the Ring to ease their way an lessen their costs. Greatgroups of Machines, linked together, will speed trade throughoutMicro Earth and all will benefit. The Ring opens many doors, andSauron gains nothing from our passage into most. He forged the Ring,but we can control its Power."</P><P>Legolas considered what Boromir had said. "I see no differencebetween the great Ring system you describe and the vast Machines thatrule Mainframe Earth," he said. "The same problems may arise. A breakin the link can disrupt many, not just one. Secrets can be piratedaway down the dark passages. The system grows ever more complex, notlike the simple Machines we now use."</P><P>The elf continued, "There is no gain, only a further loss of theindividuality that is slipping like sand through our fingers. A giantcollection of simple Machines? Nay, I say that is a great waste. Ifmany must speak, let them use the Machines of Mainframe. I dream ofseeing our LAN lush with trees and Fruit, not bound with chains ofwire."</P><P>Frodo was again confused. "I see the advantage for the Traders,"he said, "but of what use is the Ring to simple folk who wish fornothing more than a warm home and a cold beer?"</P><P>Boromir answered, "Through the Power of the Ring, common folk willbe able to bank without leaving their homes; they will have access tothe Great Markets where stocks are traded, and the financial universeshall open before them. Travelers will be able to obtain rooms atinns, spare horses or berths on the Wind Ships from their diningrooms. Many will be their options."</P><P>Bilbo smiled sarcastically and whispered to Frodo, "Boromir thinksa commoner is someone with only one Mercedes."</P><P>Gandalf rose to his feet and spoke in his most commanding voice,"The time has come to stop this debate and decide our course ofaction. We may cast the Ring into the Cracks of doom and destroy it,or wield it and face the consequences, good or ill."</P><P>Frodo spoke, "I will take the Ring to the South, toward Gondor andthe Realm of Sauron. It is a long journey, and Destiny will decideour course."</P><P>Few of the folk around the table had expected such a statement&gt;from the quiet hobbit, but quickly they nodded in unspokenagreement: Frodo should lead them to the edge of Sauron's domain.Perhaps then the great forces of Destiny would act to show theway.</P><P>As Frodo and Bilbo walked down the stone path to the small roomthey shared, the elder hobbit looked at his friend and asked him whyhe had chosen this way to travel.</P><P>Frodo walked on in silence for a moment, as if concerned only withnot tripping over cracks in the stones. "I know that the Traders canuse the Ring to great advantage, and all of Micro Earth will beenriched," he said. "I fear that Gandalf and Legolas are also right,that creativity and innovation are curtailed by Sauron's scheme."</P><P>"Though no noe mentioned it, I believe that fewer new and unusualspells will be written if the Ring becomes the way of things andpeople look to share one great spell, rather than buying their own. Ihave yet to see any advantage for the common folk, but the naturalcuriosity of men may bring forth some unknown and useful task. Mostof all, I feel in my bones that the ring will come to be used andthought of differently than anyone now suspects."</P><P>"I will go toward Sauron and the Cracks and hope that along theway I am given a sign to follow. The Ring tempts me. It cries out tobe worn and used. Another voice inside me wishes I had never heard ofSauron or his Ring. I may destroy it, or I may give it to Sauron andhelp him wield it. I only fear that I will have to choose before Iknow which course is right."</P><P>The two hobbits continued down the path without speaking, bothknowing that further words were unnecessary. The greatest minds onMicro Earth had been gathered around that table, and Bilbo saw thatFrodo had the farthest reaching vision of all.</P><P>The histories of both micro and Mainframe Earths were full ofleaps into the unknown, some successful and some not. Perhaps, Bilbothought, neatness and order should be brought into the chaos. Perhapsthe Wizards should be made to try rational behavior just once.</P><P>The old hobbit laughed out loud. And perhaps they can teach a pigto sing.</P><P><I>-- William Robinson, Network World, 22 June 90</I></P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
