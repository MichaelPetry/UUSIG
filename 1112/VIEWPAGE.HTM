Things   in the same crate are called cratemates.</LI>      <LI>Crates are stored either in the workshop or a warehouse. The   workshop is almost always too small to hold all the crates.</LI>      <LI>There is only one workshop but there may be several warehouses   and everybody shares them.</LI>      <LI>Each thing has its own thing number.</LI>      <LI>What you do with a thing is to zark it. Everybody takes turns   zarking.</LI>      <LI>You can only zark your things, not anybody else's.</LI>      <LI>Things can only be zarked when they are in the workshop.</LI>      <LI>Only the THING-KING knows whether a thing is in the workshop   or in a warehouse.</LI>      <LI>The longer a thing goes without being zarked, the grubbier it   is said to become.</LI>      <LI>The way you get things is to ask the THING-KING. He only gives   out things in multiples of eight. This is to keep the royal   overhead down.</LI>      <LI>The way you zark a thing is to give its thing number. If you   give the number of a thing that happens to be in the workshop it   gets zarked right away. If it is in a warehouse, the THING-KING   packs the crate containing your thing back into the workshop. If   there is no room in the workshop, he first finds the grubbiest   crate in the workshop, whether it be yours or somebody else's, and   packs it off with all its cratemates to a warehouse. In its place   he puts the crate containing your thing. Your thing then gets   zarked and you never knew it wasn't in the workshop all   along.</LI>      <LI>Each players stock of things have the same numbers as   everybody else's. The THING-KING always knows who owns what thing   and whose turn it is, so you can't ever accidentally zark somebody   else's thing even if it has the same thing thing number as one of   yours.</LI></OL><CENTER>*** <I>Notes</I> ***</CENTER><OL>   <LI>Traditionally, the THING-KING sits at a large, segmented table   and is attended to by pages &#91;the so called table pages&#93;   whose job it is to help the king remember where all the things are   and who they belong to.</LI>      <LI>One consequence of rule 13 is that everybody's thing numbers   will be similar from game to game, regardless of the number of   players.</LI>      <LI>The THING-KING has a few things of his own, some of which move   back and forth between workshop and warehouse just like anybody   else's, but some of which are just too heavy to move out of the   workshop.</LI>      <LI>With the given set of rules, oft-zarked things tend to get   kept mostly in the workshop while little zarked things stay mostly   in a warehouse. This is efficient stick control.</LI>      <LI>Sometimes even the warehouses get full. The THING-KING then   has to start piling things on the dump out back. This makes the   game slower because it takes a long time to get things off the   dump when they aren't needed in the workshop. A forthcoming change   in the rules will allow the THING-KING to select the grubbiest   things in the warehouses and send them to the dump in his spare   time, thus keeping the warehouses from getting too full. That the   most infrequently zarked things will end up in the dump so the   THING-KING wont have to get things from the dump so often. This   would speed up the game when there are lots of players and the   warehouses are getting full.</LI></OL><CENTER>*** Long live the THING-KING ***</CENTER><P>Newsletter of the University of British Columbia CPI ComputingCenter</P><P>Written by Jeff Berryman</P></BODY></HTML>
