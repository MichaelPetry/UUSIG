<b>MAIL</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.md), April 1987![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @MAIL processor allows users to send
messages to others on the system. Messages are stored in a system
mail file until they are read, at which point the user may opt to
selectively save or discard each mail item. Outgoing mail can be
retained as well. Documentation included. (MSM, REL, ABS)


<b>MAKCHGBARS</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md),
January 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Given "old" and "new" versions
of a file (element), MAKCHGBARS writes out a new copy of the file
with change bars in it. The files can contain ASCII text, or UNADS
source. The change bars can be all of the same type, or different
bars can be used for inserted, changed,and deleted text. When the
files contain ASCII source, the column number for the change bars can
be specified. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>MAPSSG</b> ([1090](1090/INDEX.md), May
1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - MAP/SSG is a utility to simplify and
standardize the collection of ACOB programs. It can be used in
conjunction with DXCBO01 or as a standalone utility. Documentation
included.(MSM)


<b>MAPPER UTILITIES BY DWD</b>
([1053](1053/INDEX.md), March 1984![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)![[MAPPER]](IMAGES/MAPPER.JPG)) - This Mapper
utilities package contains a list of all unsupported local code used
by various sites to enhance the capabilities of their Mapper systems.
This tape is a listing of all code, runstreams and documentation
submitted to the Mapper Subcommittee during their investigations for
recommendations of supported Mapper Utilities.(RIDs)


<b>MAPPER UTILITIES BY DHW</b>
([1054](1054/INDEX.md), November 1984![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)![[MAPPER]](IMAGES/MAPPER.JPG)) - Mapper
Coordinator and run designer utility runs and aids. Includes remote
coordinator administration runs and a simplified mail system. Utility
runs include an automated MAPPER system statistics log based on LOGSA
and RPG2 coordinator runs. Aids include ECL and MASM source for
multi-tape Premap and ECL and COBOL source to produce a comprehensive
cross reference listing of run variables and labels. (RIDs)


<b>MAPPER UTILITIES BY NKI</b>
([1059](1059/INDEX.md), April 1986![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)![[MAPPER]](IMAGES/MAPPER.JPG)) - This package
contains 50 utilities including: a utility catalog application which
contains documentation for 50 utilities (some utilities are not
included, since they are part of every MAPPER system, examples are
'Tutor' and 'FCC') and the method of controlling access to all
utilities; a password (including coded) changer; a dynamic menu
system; bulletin board capability; and various other
utilities.Documentation included. (RIDs)


<b>MARS</b> ([1080](1080/INDEX.md), November
1995![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The MARS Processor and its associated
collection of programs and runstreams won the 1990 UPLI Contribution
Award for the best software submission during 1990. MARS provides a
means of mass storage management that is much more flexible and
user-friendly than the standard FAS archive. Its major advantages
are: (1) user control of archive parameters by file, (2) automatic
expiration of archive tapes (expiration is file-dependent), (3)
interactive reload, and (4) batch reload processor.Interactive reload
of any file on a current FAS SAVE or SAVALL tape is also available.
Also provided with MARS is the Archive Copy Processor (ACP), which
can do disc-disc copies about four times as fast as standard FURPUR,
and disc-tape copies about twice as fast. This is the third release
(3R1), which has several new features including archive from
removable packs and critical-file backup. It is fully
upward-compatible with the original release (2R1) and has fewer
restrictions. The MARS system is written entirely in MASM and
requires no local code. MARS is compatible with EXEC 41 and requires
SORT/MERGE. Documentation included (machine-readable as well as
printed document sent with each order). (MSM) (Not currently
available)


<b>MASS</b> ([1033](1033/INDEX.md), June
1979![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - MASS displays mass storage availability and
then generates two reports of all files sorted by device they reside
on and then by file name. Documentation included. (ASM, ABS)


<b>MBNC</b> ([1051](1081/INDEX.md), November
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Reads and rewrites a sector of the file on
the processor call. If that fails, it uses the DWRITE function of the
MSCON$ executive request to modify the written state of the
file.(ELT)


<b>MBNC2</b> ([1051](1081/INDEX.md), February
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Assigns the file on the processor call with
the "Y" option. It then uses the DWRITE function of the MSCON$
executive request to alter the written state of the file. (ELT)


<b>MCBERR</b> ([1051](1099/INDEX.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This generic processor (see GENERIC
PROCESSOR) displays the English description of Message Control Bank
(MCB) error codes, abort codes, function codes, as well Step Control
ER status codes. The English text is in element MCBERR/SGS. We'd much
appreciate any corrections or updates. Used with MCBERR/ADD,
MCBERR/SKEL and MCBERR/SGS. (MSM, SSG,ABS)


<b>MCBMOD</b> ([1051](1065/INDEX.md), July
1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - ACOB TIP program to change the MCB mode of a
terminal between normal and test/training. (ELT)

1986![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor will analyze the TOC of a
program file and generate the ECL to compile or MASM all the symbolic
elements of the type MSM, PLS, ACOB or FTN. Documentation included.
(ELT,REL, ABS)


<b>MCT</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), November
1981![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @MCT processor interrogates the system's
Master Configuration Table and edits information for it as directed
by processor options. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>MCTCHK</b> ([1082](1082/INDEX.md), June
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - MCT Check Utility is a utility that examines
the initial register set supplied by the EXEC, scans it for the
supplied information and will OR SET the last third of the condition
word with the valued supplied. MCTCHK also displays current mass
storage availability (fixed only). Users may have a MCTCHK call in a
runstream to test for EXEC level, machine type and subsequent @TEST
and @JUMPs will control the flow of the runstream. Very handy when
converting from one EXEC level to another and possible cross-boots
required, you need only one runstream with MCTCHK and JUMPs for both
levels. (ABS)


<b>MD</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the DOS MD (make
directory)command. (IPF)


<b>MENU</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), February
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program that invokes the MENU SSG skeleton to
display a menu of various items to be performed. The items are the
type of thing that would normally require a number of steps to
accomplish (like EXEC generations). (MSM, ABS)


<b>MESSAGE</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), December
1987![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The program MESSAGE simply prints lines of
text to your terminal. This is really only useful from within an
@ADDstream. (ABS)


<b>MFD</b> ([1106](1106/INDEX.md), December
1995![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - @MFD (version 8.xx) is a Master File
Directory information processor. This is the updated version of MFD
in 1051 containing the latest patches. (MSM , REL , ABS )


<b>MFD</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), June 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - @MFD (version 8.21) is a Master File
Directory information processor. Technical papers on it were
presented at the Fall 1974 Toronto and Spring 1981 (New York City)
USE Conferences. This processor provides extensive file selection
capabilities, and prints a one-line summary for each file so
selected. Totaling, sorting, and sub-totaling features are provided,
as is an optional SDF output capability. Documentation included. (MSM
1978, REL 1990, ABS 1990)


<b>MFD</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), April
1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Prints out the Master File Directory's Item
and/or DAD information for files. (ELT)

1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor pipes a file's (or,
optionally, all f-cycles') MFD data (lead item, main item and/or DAD
tables). This is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS: there are many MFD attributes it
doesn't yet handle. @CYC uses this pipeline.(MSM, ABS)

1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - ACOB TIP program to change the COM-POOL mode
of a terminal between normal and test/training.(COB)


<b>MON</b> ([1060](1060/INDEX.md), June 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - DMS Monitor (DMSMON 8R3) is a full screen
interactive DMS 1100 system monitor. DMSMON is not compatible with
UDS. UDSMON on the Unisys UDS Tape is, though. The system allows the
user to monitor:status of all runs; buffer and DMU information;
schema and subschema usage;area usage information; queuing
information; dynamic buffer usage information;current DMR
configuration; BUT and RLT usage statistics. Documentation included.
(MSM)

<b>MSMON</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), January
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A program to collect and/or report on disk
availability data. The run SF1 also collects the data (this is the
normal method of operation). A new cycle of the file is cataloged by
SF1 each time it is started. Also, the file is freed when the mass
storage monitor function of SF1 is terminated and a new cycle created
when that function is initiated.(MSM 1986, ABS 1990)
