The <font color="#AF0000">RDB</font> utility allows you to execute a
run interactively and examine the contents of variables, reserved
words, and renamed results. You can step through the run one line or
command at a time, or you can set a breakpoint to halt the run at a
specific line number, label, run command, or variable.


With this package, you can put the Run Debugger Code (first
released with MAPPER 34R1) into MAPPER level 33R1.
