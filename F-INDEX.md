<b>FAC</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), November 1976![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - See ERROR above. (ASM,ABS)


<b>FAC</b> ([1051](1065/INDEX.md), June 1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program decodes facility status bits
into an English message. It is similar to the UOM FAC processor, but
is intended to have more readable output. Documentation included.
(ELT, REL, ABS)


<b>FAC</b> ([1051](1081/INDEX.md), December 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Utility to interpret a facility octal status
code. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>FAKE-BACKUP</b> ([1051](1081/INDEX.md), July
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Used to modify the backup date, time and reel

programming problems. (ELT)


<b>FANG</b> ([1085](1085/INDEX.md), January 1982![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - FANG is a general purpose file utility
program. FANG functions as an interpreter of commands which specify
operations to be performed upon files named in the source language.
Various commands allow files to be dumped, positioned, written,
compared and edited. Other commands permit manipulation of classes of
elements in program files and data files in SDF format. FANG operates
upon all types of files provided by the EXEC-8 system. Tapes are
handled at the block level, while Fastrand and word addressable files
may be accessed in terms of simulated tape blocks or random-accessed
by specifying a sector or word address. Fang utilizes overlapped
input/output operations and concurrency of command execution to
efficiently use the facilities of the system. This mode of operation
is transparent to the user, to whom it appears that commands are
executed sequentially as entered. Documentation included. (REL, ABS)


<b>FCSSINIT</b> ([1051](1065/INDEX.md), April 1986![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - FTN batch connect program to fill any TIP

<b>FINDREF</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), April 1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - FINDREF is a front-end tool to the Unisys
product, IACULL (which is an interactive cross reference utility). In
IACULL, looking at a large number of data references can be
cumbersome, because when viewing, you must step through each data
reference. Using FINDREF, the data references are summarized and you
can selectively choose which references to look at in more detail in
IACULL. FINDREF has a vast array of commands,many of which are the
same as IACULL so FINDREF is easy to learn. Some of the basic
capabilities of FINDREF include: * Offers a full screen menu of
IACULL files available. * Locates one or more tags at once. * Appends
references to the current list of references. * Sorts the list of
references. * Saves and restores current references. Saves can also
be retained across sessions by cataloging a save file. * Accepts
IACULL commands. * Automatically senses screen size. * Trims current
references by including or excluding specific strings. * Creates a
printed listing of the references. * Creates a TCF based on the
current references. * Has on-line help. Documentation included.(ABS)

sessions that a site may have. The SYS$*BYE file will need to be
modified for each site's use. Documentation included. (SYM, ABS)

<b>FORFLO</b> ([1005](1005/INDEX.md), November
1970![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - FORFLO is an Automatic FORTRAN Flowchart
Generator which creates from any FORTRAN program a computer drawn
flowchart suitable for display on a high-speed printer. The flowchart
produced adheres as closely as possible to standard flowchart
symbols. The flowcharts produced by FORFLO can be very useful in
areas such as training, debugging and documentation. FORFLO is

<b>FREEA</b> ([1099](1099/INDEX.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor is used to free large
numbers of files from a demand run. It is a much modified (stripped
down)version of one of the many versions of FREEM that is used at
numerous sites.Its major modifications are that it has code to handle
the freeing of files assigned by the @Q processor and code to not
free a run's Working Set file(2200/900 specific). There is no 'H'
(help) option for this processor. The only option supported is the
'S' option, which will suppress the list of files freed.
