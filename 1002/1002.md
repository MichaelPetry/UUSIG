<font color="#AF0000">GASP II</font> is a FORTRAN based simulation
language for discrete event simulation models. It consists of a set
of FORTRAN subprograms organized to assist in performing simulation
studies. <font color="#AF0000">GASP II</font> formalizes an approach
to simulation by specifying common elements of simulation studies and
providing subprograms for performing those simulation tasks that are
independent of particular problems. In this way, commonality among
problems in the same general area can be visualized.


An additional test run has been added using the files TEST4 and
TESTDATA. The results are different than those given in the GASP
reference book because the random number generator produces different
results when run on a 36 bit machine. The book, "Simulation With GASP
II" by A. Alan B. Pritsker and Philip J. Kiviat is out of print, but
may be available in some university libraries.
