<font color="#AF0000">SIMSCRIPT</font> is a simulation programming
language designed for discrete event simulation modules.


The procedure for specifying Status consists of defining each
different type of Entity, Attribute, and Set on SIMSCRIPT Definition
Forms.


A separate subprogram must be written for each different kind of
Event describing how it changes the Status. There may be any number
of different kinds of Events, and a particular kind of Event may
occur repeatedly and at any desired point in simulated time. Each
kind of Event is enumerated in what is called an "Events List". Based
on this Events List, SIMSCRIPT automatically generates a main Timing
routine which keeps track of simulated time and calls the various
Event routines in the proper sequence. Time is advanced by variable
increments rather than being broken into a sequence of fixed
increments. The <font color="#AF0000">SIMSCRIPT</font> Timing routine
permits the occurrence of both Endogenous Events, those caused by
previous Events within the simulation, and Exogenous Events, those
introduced from outside the the simulation by means of an Exogenous
Event Tape.
