<font color="#AF0000">SIPTOOL</font> is a program that serves no
useful function, except as a tutorial of how to write a program that
collects SIP data. It also provides you with most of the code
necessary to begin your own SIP collection program. The source code
of the program is the tutorial. It has been painstakingly commented
to guide you through the steps necessary to successfully collect SIP
data.
