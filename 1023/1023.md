This is a library of four programs for the Univac 1108 or 1110 that
allows the user to generate or read 9-track magnetic tapes in the
proper format to be read or written by the PDP-11 DOS or RT-11
operating systems. Two tape generating programs will write any mix of
Univac data files and file elements on tape in the proper operating
system format on a one-to-one basic, one Univac file for one tape
file. The two tape reading programs will place the wanted tape files
into Univac data files. In all cases, Univac files will be FIELDATA
and tape files will be ASCII.
