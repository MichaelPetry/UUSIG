<font color="#AF0000">DMP</font> is a utility program that provides a
broad range of services to the Unisys 2200 Series user. These
services may be accessed by submitting any of nearly 160 different
commands. Commands are usually submitted during an interactive
session (through a terminal or via the system operator's console) but
can be submitted as a batch run. There is considerable overlap
between some <font color="#AF0000">DMP</font> commands and the
standard OS/1100 FURPUR utility. In some cases <font color="#AF0000">DMP</font> duplicates FURPUR functions but with
improved performance. Not all <font color="#AF0000">DMP</font>
commands have a FURPUR counterpart, and vice versa. Areas addressed
by DMP include: high speed file and element set copying, element name
masking (UNIX convention), element set copying from COPY,G tape; file
comparison; file dumping; macro language; assisted access to system
tables such as PCT, MCT, PCT Item, PCT name table, run condition
word, MFD, tape labels, program file header, disk volume labels,
COPY,G header block, quota set buffer, PCT security buffer, symbiont
output queues; system log entry editing, hardware fault entries,
hardware I/O error entries, octal dump of any entry type; file search
for an arbitrary string or octal value. Recent changes to OS/1100
make some of the functions, long supported by <font color="#AF0000">DMP</font>, impossible (such as dumping PCT items).
However, during its long life, <font color="#AF0000">DMP</font> has
proved to be robust in the face of continuing changes to OS/1100.
<font color="#AF0000">DMP</font> has not been exposed to SB4 as of
May 1, 1991 but it should work well under any supported release of
the Executive.
