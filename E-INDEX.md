- - -
**EACQ** ([1099](1099/1099.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor does an "extended
acquire" to allow you to position extents of a file on the pack you
want.


**ECHO** ([1051](1051/1051.md), January
1979![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This is a simple little processor, whose
purpose is just to echo (in full ASCII) all data supplied to it. This
turns out to be much more usable than @MSG,N when documenting
runstreams or @ADD streams, since it wastes less paper, is full
ASCII, and produces output even when an @ADD stream is invoked from a
demand terminal. (MSM, ABS)


**ECHO** ([1077](1077/1077.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the DOS ECHO command.(IPF)


**ECOPY** ([1067](1067/1067.md), April
1973![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(ABS)


**EDCDIC-2-SDF** ([1065](1065/1065.md),
March 1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Processor which copies data
between unlabeled EBCDIC tapes and SDF files. Documentation
included.(ABS)

**ERROR** ([1051](1051/1051.md), November
1976![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor accepts FAC REJECT statuses or contingency error codes from the user, and calls ER ERRPR$ to retrieve and print descriptions of the errors. Documentation
included.(ABS)

**ERROR** ([1067](1067/1067.md), August
1985![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @ERROR utility decodes operating system error messages. These messages are usually in the form of a name and a number, e.g. "IO 22" or "IGDM 00". Documentation included. (MSM 1977, REL 1985, ABS 1985)

**ERROR** ([1081](1081/1081.md), January
1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Deciphers a system error code. Documentation
included. (MSM, ABS)

**ERROR** ([1084](1084/1084.md), October
1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A processor of the same name that can be used
to print an English message for the 'TYPE nn CODE nn CONT nn'
messages that are displayed when a program errors. The calling
sequence is @ERROR error-type,error-code[,contingency-type]. (ELT,
ABS)


**ESCAN** ([1092](1092/1092.md), November
1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - An ECL scanning routine; checks syntax, lists
files accessed and files referenced; verifies packids and VOLSER's
against STAR-1100. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


**ETP** ([1084](1084/1084.md), July 1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This run Es all active transaction programs.
MSCP must be running for ETP to work (it will ask you to start MSCP
if it is not running). (ABS)


**EXA** ([1081](1081/1081.md), February
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to exit the editor and add
the File/Element being edited. Prefixing the command with LN will
cause the images being added to be listed. If the editor is in
READ-ONLY mode an omit is done. (ELT)


**EXCEPTIONS** ([1084](1084/1084.md),
January 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor will list all
files whose backups are either old (over 1 month) or whose backup
tapes have been reused. Output is: File-name back-up
file-name-of-tape-in-STAR flags. The backup tape has been reused if
'file-name-of-tape-in-STAR' is not 'OBACKUPx'.'flags' are 'O' for old
backup, 'U' if the file is unloaded, and 'R' if the file exists on a
removable pack. (ABS)


**EXE** ([1081](1081/1081.md), January
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to exit the editor and
reenter in a read-only mode. This is for lazy programmers who can't
remember what they're editing or don't want to retype it. (ELT)


**EXF** ([1081](1081/1081.md), January
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to enter @IPF via the @FED processor that is supplied in this package.


**EXONLY** ([1051](1051/1051.md), February
1982![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(MSM 1982, ABS 1980)
