<b>EACQ</b> ([1099](1099/INDEX.HTM), September
1993![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor does an "extended
acquire" to allow you to position extents of a file on the pack you
want.


<b>ECHO</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), January
1979![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This is a simple little processor, whose
purpose is just to echo (in full ASCII) all data supplied to it. This
turns out to be much more usable than @MSG,N when documenting
runstreams or @ADD streams, since it wastes less paper, is full
ASCII, and produces output even when an @ADD stream is invoked from a
demand terminal. (MSM, ABS)


<b>ECHO</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the DOS ECHO command.(IPF)


<b>ECOPY</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.HTM), April
1973![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(ABS)


<b>EDCDIC-2-SDF</b> ([1065](1065/INDEX.HTM),
March 1989![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Processor which copies data
between unlabeled EBCDIC tapes and SDF files. Documentation
included.(ABS)


<b>ERROR</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), November
1976![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor accepts FAC REJECT statuses or
contingency error codes from the user, and calls ER ERRPR$ to
retrieve and print descriptions of the errors. Documentation
included.(ABS)


<b>ERROR</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.HTM), August
1985![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @ERROR utility decodes operating system
error messages. These messages are usually in the form of a name and
a number, e.g. "IO 22" or "IGDM 00". Documentation included. (MSM
1977, REL 1985, ABS 1985)


<b>ERROR</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), January
1991![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Deciphers a system error code. Documentation
included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>ERROR</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM), October
1989![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A processor of the same name that can be used
to print an English message for the 'TYPE nn CODE nn CONT nn'
messages that are displayed when a program errors. The calling
sequence is @ERROR error-type,error-code[,contingency-type]. (ELT,
ABS)


<b>ESCAN</b> ([1092](1092/INDEX.HTM), November
1991![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - An ECL scanning routine; checks syntax, lists
files accessed and files referenced; verifies packids and VOLSER's
against STAR-1100. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>ETP</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM), July 1989![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This run Es all active transaction programs.
MSCP must be running for ETP to work (it will ask you to start MSCP
if it is not running). (ABS)


<b>EXA</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), February
1992![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to exit the editor and add
the File/Element being edited. Prefixing the command with LN will
cause the images being added to be listed. If the editor is in
READ-ONLY mode an omit is done. (ELT)


<b>EXCEPTIONS</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM),
January 1991![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor will list all
files whose backups are either old (over 1 month) or whose backup
tapes have been reused. Output is: File-name back-up
file-name-of-tape-in-STAR flags. The backup tape has been reused if
'file-name-of-tape-in-STAR' is not 'OBACKUPx'.'flags' are 'O' for old
backup, 'U' if the file is unloaded, and 'R' if the file exists on a
removable pack. (ABS)


<b>EXE</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), January
1992![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to exit the editor and
reenter in a read-only mode. This is for lazy programmers who can't
remember what they're editing or don't want to retype it. (ELT)


<b>EXF</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), January
1992![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to enter @IPF via the@FED
processor that is supplied in this package.


<b>EXONLY</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), February
1982![](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(MSM 1982,
ABS 1980)
