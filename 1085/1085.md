<font color="#AF0000">FANG</font> is a general purpose file utility
program. <font color="#AF0000">FANG</font> functions as an
interpreter of commands which specify operations to be performed upon
files named in the source language. Various commands allow files to
be dumped, positioned, written, compared, and edited. Other commands
permit manipulation of classes of elements in program files and data
files in SDF format. <font color="#AF0000">FANG</font> operates upon
all types of files provided by the OS1100 system. Tapes are handled
at the block level, while Fastrand and word addressable files may be
accessed in terms of simulated tape blocks or random-accessed by
specifying a sector or word address. <font color="#AF0000">FANG</font> utilizes overlapped input/output
operations and concurrency of command execution to efficiently use
the facilities of the system. This mode of operation is transparent
to the user, to whom it appears that commands are executed
sequentially as entered.
