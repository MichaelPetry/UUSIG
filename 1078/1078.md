Contribution Award.</b>


An update to <font color="#AF0000">TIPMON</font> was made in
February 1991 to enable it to run under Exec 41R6. <font color="#AF0000">TIPMON</font> is a stand-alone, full-screen processor
that provides online TIP memory configuration data, such as
current/min/max/average sizes, as well as contractions and expansions
per memory group. A number of screens are provided that show current
placement of stuck or executing I and DBanks (by name if HVTIP).
Originally developed to monitor LINC 1100 usage, it has been expanded
to monitor all TIP memory accesses. <font color="#AF0000">TIPMON</font> thus provides the user with a tool for
setting and maintaining initial bank numbers and sizes to increase
system performance. <font color="#AF0000">TIPMON</font> is compatible
with EXEC 41 and MASM level 4 or 5.


<font color="#AF0000">USEPRINT</font> (June 1990) is a stand alone
processor that allows users to access files, including TIP dumps and
batch run outputs, that are on print queues.


Also included with this package are some DBE macros that provide
information on RDMS tables.
