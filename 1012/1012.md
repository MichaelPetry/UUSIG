This program file processor will salvage a program file containing
bad elements. <font color="#AF0000">SALVAGE</font> is designed to
help restore files whose newly allocated granules are victimized by a
system crash. A bad symbolic element may be salvaged by reverting to
a deleted element or by accepting the present element up to the point
of error and using the Text Editor to make the necessary corrections.


Usage is similar to to @COPY,P. <font color="#AF0000">SALVAGE</font> is interactive in demand mode.
