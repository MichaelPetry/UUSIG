<font color="#AF0000">FLOBOL</font> is a system made up of five
programs combined with four utility sorts. It is designed to
automatically generate computer-produced flowcharts.

As a by-product of the flowcharting function, <font color="#AF0000">FLOBOL</font> will optionally produce a program
cross-reference listing to COBOL programs. This option may be used
independently of the flowcharting capabilities if desired.
