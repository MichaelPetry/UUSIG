- Byte Manipulation Subroutines. These subroutines allow a user
       to perform byte manipulation without the complex setup needed to
       use byte hardware. ASCII/FIELDATA conversions are handled
       automatically. Because of byte manipulation instructions, usage is
       restricted to 1100/80s or 1100/60s.
    
       
- Editor, Quick. Quick and efficient one pass SDF editor. Has
       the ability to edit print control images. Uses Sperry editor- type
       commands.
    
       
- SDF File Printer. This program will print portions of an SDF
       print file based on report headings specified by user. Specific
       reports as well as ranges of reports can be specified.
    
       
- Program File Checker. This program will check a file or
       element for certain conditions and set the condition word
       accordingly. The file conditions checked are: File exists, not
       empty; File is empty; File does not exist or is unassignable; File
       is not program file. Similar conditions are checked for elements
       in a program file with the element type also placed in condition
       word.

       account and certain characteristics for a given file. Certain file
       changes will work only if user is privileged.
