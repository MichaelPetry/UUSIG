<font color="#AF0000">AUTO</font> is an automated scheduling utility
for Unisys 1100/2200 computers. <font color="#AF0000">AUTO</font> was
designed and written by Steve J. Martin. Tom Nelson contributed
greatly to testing and packaging <font color="#AF0000">AUTO</font>,
and he created the SGS that SOLAR can use to install AUTO as a local
product.

<font color="#AF0000">AUTO</font> allows you to direct that
certain tasks be performed at given times on given days. It is
written in Symbolic Stream Generator (SSG) and requires SSG level
23R1 or above. If your site has installed System Base (SB) 5R3 or
above, then you have the required SSG level; otherwise, see the
special instructions below. See the important discussion below on SSG
release levels.

Writing <font color="#AF0000">AUTO</font> in SSG provides several
advantages: development time is minimized; considerable functionality
can be provided in few lines of code; all Unisys 1100/2200 sites have
SSG, as it's part of the Operating System Group of products. SSG also
has a disadvantage: since it's an interpreter, it requires more
system resources than does compiled code. I don't think you will find
this a problem unless you have a very large schedule or a very small
or overworked 2200.
