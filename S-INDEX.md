discriminate analysis; analysis of variance; cross tabulation; output
of graphs and tales; and output of transformed, recoded, reformatted,

a major inconvenience. This processor reads a set of RUN$files (which can include site-defined RUN$ files as well as standard Unisys RUN$
files) and registers for the ST* keyin via ER KEYIN$. When an PST*
keyin is received this processor attempts to @START,/U the named
element out of each RUN$ file in turn. Since this processor is not
meant for demand users, the 'H' (help) option is not provided.(MSM,
ABS)

'L' option). If your Exec level is below 43R4, you must set the
PCTLEVEL tag in PCTDEF to the appropriate value and recompile PCTDEF
and SYSID. @SYSID uses the value of PCTLEVEL to determine the format
of the System Id Table and EXERR History Table. (MSM, ABS)

**SYSPROP$** ([1051](1051/1051.md), May
1983![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available. (MSM 1983,
