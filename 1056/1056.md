**TIP/DPS programs:**


   
- FLGBOX - Displays the current settings of the flagbox bits.
    
       
- FILENO - Displays pertinent information about a given TIP or
       TIP/DMS file.
    
       
- PASSWD - Allows changing of a TIP/DPS password, while leaving
       the userid and security profile intact.


**COBOL subroutine:** GP237A - Allows a left
justified DISPLAY field (30 char limit) to become right justified.
There are four entry points possible, allowing for optional field
compaction and either leading spaces or leading zeroes. CP0113 is the
linkage parameter to be passed back and forth.


**KERMIT tape routine:** READ COLUTAPE - This ECL
compiles the COBOL program ANSID and the MASM subroutine H18510,
collects them together and then executes the resulting absolute to
load a KERMIT release tape, ANSID format.


**MAPPER graphics routine:** PLOT-GRAPH-DRAW - These
runs provide enhanced and streamlined MAPPER graphics and will be
faster than regular MAPPER graphics, provide more options, and allow
up to four graphs per page.
