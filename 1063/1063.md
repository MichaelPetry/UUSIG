<font color="#AF0000">PEEK</font> is a software package that allows
you to monitor any program that is running in the system. It shows
where the program is spending its time, what ERs are called and where
they are called from, and what banks and segments are being used. No
changes to the program being monitored are required and it suffers no
significant performance degradation while being monitored. The <font color="#AF0000">@PEEK</font> package consists of local-code operating
system changes, a program to gather statistics, and a program to
process and display the statistics interactively on a UTS-20 or
similar terminal.
