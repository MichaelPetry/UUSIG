**BATCH SCHEDULER** ([1076](1076/1076.md),
June 1988, November 1989 ![2200](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The Batch Scheduler is a system which selects and starts batch jobs from a master schedule. The RSI$ interface is used to start jobs as though they had originated from the system console. A number of selection criteria are available. A start time, account and userid are required input. Project id and set
value are optional. A clearance level must be provided if the Exec is
configured with security on. The system consists of three programs:
(1) the Schedule selects and schedules the jobs and prints the daily
schedule; (2) the Starter starts the jobs periodically throughout the
day; and (3) the Operations Override provides a tool for Operations
to make adjustments to the daily schedule. Documentation included.

1983 ![2200](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @BK1 and @BK2 (see following)processors provide a simple means of dealing with breakpointed print files. @BK1 may be used to create a cataloged or temporary file and @BRKPT PRINT$ to it. @BK2 may then be used to @BRKPT PRINT$ back to normal, and
examine, print or hold the resulting file. Documentation included.
