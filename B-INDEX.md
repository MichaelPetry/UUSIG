<b>BATCH SCHEDULER</b> ([1076](1076/INDEX.HTM),
June 1988, November 1989 ![2200](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The Batch Scheduler is a system
which selects and starts batch jobs from a master schedule. The RSI$
interface is used to start jobs as though they had originated from
the system console. A number of selection criteria are available. A
start time, account and userid are required input. Project id and set
value are optional. A clearance level must be provided if the Exec is
configured with security on. The system consists of three programs:
(1) the Schedule selects and schedules the jobs and prints the daily
schedule; (2) the Starter starts the jobs periodically throughout the
day; and (3) the Operations Override provides a tool for Operations
to make adjustments to the daily schedule. Documentation included.

1983 ![2200](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @BK1 and @BK2 (see following)processors
provide a simple means of dealing with breakpointed print files.@BK1
