<font color="#AF0000">DX</font> is a debugging system giving the user
complete control of the execution of an absolute program. While <font color="#AF0000">DX</font> is in Run Mode, the program under test runs
at full speed, returning to DX Control Mode upon normal or error
termination or on encountering a previously set breakpoint. At this
time, register and memory contents can be inspected or altered.
Execution can be resumed at any chosen location, either in single-or
multiple-step fashion, or by returning to Run Mode. The command
structure is simple and the output clear and compact. The average
user familiar with the 1100 series instruction set can master the
basic features of <font color="#AF0000">DX</font> in an hour or less.
The system is usable on any 1100 series machine.
