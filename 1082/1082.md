A new version of the Symbiont Queue Editor <font color="#AF0000">(SQED 1100 2R3</font>) was received in January, 1992.
<font color="#AF0000">SQED</font> allows the user to manipulate print
queues by deleting, requeueing or changing priority. <font color="#AF0000">SQED's</font> commands are similar to @ED. <font color="#AF0000">SQED</font> also has a built-in (read only) editor to
allow users to view their print before printing or even siting a
portion of the print. This update fixes a contingency handler
problem. Absolute only.


A new version of Cache Recovery/Checking Utility (<font color="#AF0000">CACHECHK 1R5</font>) was received in October, 1991.
<font color="#AF0000">CACHECHK</font> is a utility that aids in CACHE
RECOVERY situations. <font color="#AF0000">CACHECHK</font> will now
TPASG any file that is TPFREE'd, not just the files that were cache
disabled. This version of <font color="#AF0000">CACHECHK</font>

printing the final status to the console. Absolute only.

2R1</font>) is a utility designed to aid in the Benchmarking of

flexible. It supports both sector and word addressable files and
allows for dynamic reconfiguration. This version of <font color="#AF0000">DBENCH 1100</font> contains a change for the
parameter REQUESTS-PER-SECOND. If "0," <font color="#AF0000">DBENCH</font> will attempt to achieve the highest I/O
rate possible without tracking the Request Existence Time (RET).
Absolute only.


The <font color="#AF0000">SORTASG 1R5 </font>processor will
calculate file sizes for specified sort files and dynamically assign
the files for the user/run. Absolute only.

(default configuration) TIP memory. Absolute only.


MCT Check Utility (<font color="#AF0000">MCTCHK 1R1B</font>) is a
utility that examines the initial register set supplied by the EXEC,
scans it for the supplied information and will OR or SET the last
