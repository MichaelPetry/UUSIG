<font color="#AF0000">SPICE</font> is a digital computer program that
simulates the electrical performance of electronics circuits. The
program will determine the quiescent operating point of the circuit,
the time domain response of the circuit, or the small signal
frequency domain response of the circuit. Many analysis options are
available such as noise, distortion, and analysis at different
temperatures. <font color="#AF0000">SPICE</font> contains built-in
models for diodes, BJT's, JFET's and MOSFET's.


The input syntax is free format and the program supplies
reasonable default values for model parameters not specified. <font color="#AF0000">SPICE</font> uses dynamic memory allocation to store
elements, models and output values. Thus, the only limitation imposed
by the program on the size or complexity of the circuit is that all
necessary data fit in memory. <font color="#AF0000">SPICE</font> uses
modified nodal analysis to formulate the circuit matrix.
