information for RDS down-line loads (for a specified branch
number).(ABS)

**DMP** ([1089](1089/1089.md), July 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - DMP is a utility program that provides abroad
range of services to the Unisys 2200 Series user. These services may
be accessed by submitting any of nearly 160 different commands.
Commands are usually submitted during an interactive session (through a terminal or via the system operator's console) but can be submitted as a batch run. There is considerable overlap between some DMP
commands and the standard OS/1100 FURPUR utility. In some cases DMP
duplicates FURPUR functions but with improved performance. Not all
DMP commands have a FURPUR counterpart, and vice versa.Areas
addressed by DMP include: high speed file and element set
copying,element name masking (UNIX convention), element set copying
from COPY,G tape;file comparison; file dumping; macro language;
assisted access to system tables such as PCT, MCT, PCT Item, PCT name
table, run condition word, MFD, tape labels, program file header,
disk volume labels, COPY,G header block, quota set buffer, PCT
security buffer, symbiont output queues; system log entry
editing,hardware fault entries, hardware I/O error entries, octal
dump of any entry type; file search for an arbitrary string or octal
value. Recent changes to OS/1100 make some of the functions, long
supported by DMP, impossible (such as dumping PCT items). However,
during its long life, DMP has proved to be robust in the face of
continuing changes to OS/1100. DMP has not been exposed to SB4 as of
May 1, 1991 but it should work well under any supported release of
the Executive. (MSM, REL, ABS)

**DMR-ANALYZER** ([1066](1066/1066.md), November
1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - DMR-ANALYZER is a tool which enables the
database Analyst or the Applications Programmer to manage the
day-to-day operations of a DMS 1100 system by providing an on-line
method to obtain information on the internal functioning of the DMR.
This product provides the following functions: Run Unit Evaluation;
Schema/Subschema Utilization; Area, Record and Set Utilization; DMR
Internal Table Utilization;Octal to Decimal Utilization; Date/Time
Stamp Conversion; Error Message Descriptions; Queue Reason
Descriptions. Documentation included.(ASM)

**DMSCK** ([1061](1061/1061.md), April 1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - DMS 1100 DUMP and LOG tape verification
program. This program will verify the data and format of DMS 1100
dump tapes created by copy, gm, secure, tipouts, and IRU4 dump tapes.
Original code was written be Larry Legore. Code was added to handle
IRU4 dump tapes. Additional information about the program can be
found at the beginning of the source code.(ASM, ABS)

**DMSERR** ([1099](1099/1099.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor displays the English
description of Data Management System (DMS) 1100 internal, external
and rollback errors, plus DMS command codes and Universal Data System

1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Display/non-display of line numbers.(IPF)

**DO** ([1097](1097/1097.md), July 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Allows a user to shorten one or more ECL
commands into one easy to type mnemonic command. In order to do this,
a series of dictionary elements named DO$DICT are necessary. For
convenience the program DO is normally copied into the user's TPF$.
Documentation included. (ABS)

**DOWN** ([1067](1067/1067.md), May 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @DOWN Processor is primarily a symbolic
comparer. It is used to compare symbolic texts (usually, but not
limited to,SDF format) after which it can produce a SIR correction
deck capable of transforming one text into the other. @DOWN will
accept program files, data files or program file elements as input
and can also make certain superficial comparisons regarding the table
of contents of program files. (MSM, REL,ABS)

**DOWN** ([1077](1077/1077.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the MVS/ISPF DOWN command.(IPF)

**DREAD** ([1051](1051/1051.md), July 1979![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor reads the directory items for
a cataloged file, and can be directed to display ALL the retrieved
information. It is designed to check every bit in the selected
directory items, and will, for example, tell you if an undefined bit
is set. Documentation included. (ASM, ABS)

**DTPI** ([1084](1084/1084.md), July 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available. (ELT 1988,

**DUMP** ([1069](1069/1069.md), May 1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The purpose of this utility is to dump and/or
copy files on tape or mass storage. Dump formats are Fieldata,
octal,or both. It can be used to process tapes with parity or frame
count errors. Dump listings can be labeled as secrets or confidential
when appropriate. Documentation included. (ABS)

**DUMP-SCRATCH** ([1065](1065/1065.md), August
1986![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - FTN batch connect program to dump the
beginning of any PID's scratch area in the DPS terminal file. Also
gives screen number of the open screen for that PID. Parameters must
be adjusted to size of a site's terminal file records. (FTN)

**DUN** ([1081](1081/1081.md), January 1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to delete all lines until
argument text is not found. (ELT)

Documentation included. (ELT, REL, ABS)

**DX** ([1045](1045/1045.md), March 1981![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - DX is a debugging system giving the user
complete control of the execution of an absolute program. While DX is
in Run Mode, the program under test runs at full speed, returning to
DX Control Mode upon normal or error termination or on encountering a
previously set breakpoint. At this time, register and memory contents
can be inspected or altered. Execution can be resumed at any chosen
location, either in single- or multiple-step fashion, or by returning
to Run Mode. The command structure is simple and the output clear and
compact. The average user familiar with the 1100 series instruction
set can master the basic features of DX in an hour or less. The
system is usable on any 1100 series machine. (MSM 1980, REL 1980,ABS
1981)

**DXCBO01** ([1090](1090/1090.md), October 1989
![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - CBSUBLIB is a collection of MASM routines,
SSG and ECL runstreams, which together allow for the development and
productive use of ACOB subroutines in common banks. In most cases the
subroutines can be changed significantly without having to recollect
the calling programs, resulting in lower maintenance costs. NOTE:
ACOB subroutines to be used with CBSUBLIB should follow certain
programming guidelines, which are describe in accompanying
documentation. Subroutine access to RDMS 1100 and FMS-8 databases is
supported. Currently no other database access is allowed.
Documentation included. (ABS)
