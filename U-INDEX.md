- - -
<b>ULR</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), November 1989<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Updates the date and time of
the last reference for the file on the processor call to the current
date and time.(ELT)


<b>UNDELETE</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.HTM), April
1980<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - The @UNDELETE
processor resurrects deleted elements from a program file. Repeated
calls to undelete the same element causes successively older copies
of that element to be resurrected. If no older copy exists, UNDELETE
wraps around and undeletes the last copy in the file. Documentation
included. (MSM, REL, ABS)


<b>UNDELETE</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), February
1993<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Reestablishes
deleted element in program file. Documentation included. (ELT 1993,
ABS 1993)


<b>UNS</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Works like the CTS UNSAVE
command.(IPF)


<b>UNSAVE</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Works like the CTS UNSAVE
command.(IPF)


<b>UNV</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), August 1982<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This processor may be used
to place the"V" (unload inhibit) option on a file, or to remove it.
(MSM 1982, ABS 1979)


<b>UP</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Works like the MVS/ISPF UP
command.(IPF)


<b>UPDIR</b> ([1099](1099/INDEX.HTM), September
1993<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This processor
performs the UPDIR$ function of ER MSCON$ to ask the Exec to update
the MFD for a file, rather than waiting for/the file to be @FREEd.
This forces the Exec to record any DAD(Device Area Descriptor) table
expansion, which might otherwise be lost should the system fail. It's
particularly useful for UDS sites that leave files assigned to a
Common Name Section. This processor works on Exec 43R6 (SB4R6) or
above. Please carefully read the comments at the top of this program
before using it. (MSM, ABS)


<b>UPPERCASE</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May
1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Works like the
VM/XEDIT UPPERCASE command. (IPF)


<b>UPTS</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM), December
1988<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Unified Peripheral
Test Software.Replaces PTS. (ABS)


<b>USEPRINT</b> ([1078](1078/INDEX.HTM), June
1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - USEPRINT is a
stand-alone processor that allows users to access files, including
TIP dumps and batch run outputs,that are on print queues.
Documentation included. (ELT, REL,ABS)


<b>USD</b>
([1065](http://www.crewstone.com/%26amp%3B127pli/1065/index.html),
March 1988<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This MASM program
is executed by a batch run. The program uses ER RSI$ to create a
demand run that operates on a TWAIT$ basis. Every 30 seconds it
checks the tape drives for outstanding mounts. If any are found, a
message is sent to the operator's console. Every 30 minutes it issues
an II timer RC keyin to each active DMS 1100 timer run, as well as
selected other @@CONS keyins. The output displays on the operator
console and pagewriter. The table of keyins may be expanded or
contracted as desired.(ELT)


<b>USR</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM), October 1990<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Program description not
available. (MSM, ABS)


<b>USTDMP</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.HTM), January
1988<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Processor to dump
the specified unit's Unit Status Tables (LDUST and PDUST). (ABS)


<b>UUENCODE</b> ([1109](1109/INDEX.HTM), July 1996![[A Series]](../IMAGES/ASERIES.JPG)) - UUENCODE Utility for the A
Series. (ALGOL)
