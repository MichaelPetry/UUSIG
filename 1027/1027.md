<font color="#AF0000">STATJOB</font> is a system of statistical
programs developed for use on Sperry 1100 series computers. The <font color="#AF0000">STATJOB</font> system currently includes programs in
these areas: single column frequency counts; univariate statistics
with histograms; correlation and descriptive statistics; linear
regression analysis; factor analysis; discriminate analysis; analysis
of variance; cross tabulation; output of graphs and tables; and
output of transformed, recoded, reformatted, or sorted data sets.
Each of the general programs now in the STATJOB system functions
independently of the others, though all of them use the same
operating system and have available to them the many advanced
capabilities of the system.
