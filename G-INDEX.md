<b>GASP II</b> ([1002](1002/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - GASP II is a FORTRAN based simulation
language for discrete event simulation models. It consists of a set
of FORTRAN subprograms organized to assist in performing simulation
studies. GASP II formalizes an approach to simulation by specifying
common elements of simulation studies and providing subprograms for
performing those simulation tasks that are independent of particular
problems. In this way, commonality among problems in the same general
area can be visualized. (FTN)


<b>GEN</b> ([1100](1100/INDEX.md), October
1995![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The SBA COBOL Gen Utility (@GEN) was written
to dynamically generate COBOL precompile, compile and/or map ECL to
meet the current needs of every SBA COBOL program.


<b>GENER8</b> ([1099](1099/INDEX.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor takes the pipeline produced by
@FASPL/@SELECT and generates commands (ECL or otherwise) in TPF$.ECL.


<b>GENERIC PROCESSORS</b>
([1099](1099/INDEX.md), September 1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The four generic processors are CYC, DISK,
MCBERR and SELECT. See individual program listings for information.


<b>GENTAGS</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), December
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Gentags is program that displays some useful
current Exec configuration tags grouped according to Logging, Quota,
Run Scheduling and Security. Some so-called "absolute value" tag
settings are also returned. Documentation included. (ABS)


<b>GETAPE</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), March
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Catalogs a tape with reel number solicited
from the console. (ELT, ABS)


<b>GINFO</b> ([1070](1070/INDEX.md), August
1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Ginfo is a set of EXEC changes that
implements a new executive request (GINFO$) that gathers a variety of
performance statistics and makes them available to applications
programs via an executive request. GINFO$ provides information about
CPU usage, I/O accesses,executive request usage, cache disk
performance, memory usage, etc. It allows relatively easy
implementation of software tools that support real-time system
performance monitoring and which augment the monitoring software
supplied by Unisys. Three programs are included that use the GINFO$
ER to display performance information on a CRT. FWHAT displays
summary statistics for the entire system and shows the relative
amount of CPU time and I/O accesses being used by each run. ERMON
displays information about a user-specified ER,showing the number of
times each run in the system is calling that ER each second. FACTS
displays detailed information about up to 10 activities in one or
more runs. Documentation included. (ELTs)


<b>GOLF</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), November
1975![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(BAS)


<b>GP237A</b> ([1056](1056/INDEX.md), October
1983![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - COBOL subroutine which allows a left
justified DISPLAY field (30 character limit) to become right
justified. there are four entry points possible, allowing for
optional field compaction and either leading spaces or leading zeros.
CP0113 is the linkage parameter to be passed back and forth. (COB)


<b>GRAB</b> ([1051](1065/INDEX.md), December
1986![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program uses ER SMOQUE$ to allow a user
to view a file in a symbiont queue. It is useful for looking at batch
PRINT$ files when a printer is not available. (MSM, ABS)


<b>GREP</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works kind of like the UNIX GREP
command.(IPF)


<b>GSCS</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), January
1987![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Generates a data file. Input images are
cataloged tape file names and the output file contains the names and
the reel numbers (F-cycle numbers are also included). (MSM, ABS)


<b>GWDATE</b> ([1065](1065/INDEX.md), March
1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - GWDATE converts a Gregorian date into a work
day of month; WGDATE does the opposite. Documentation included.
(ELT,COB, REL)
