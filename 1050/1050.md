The <font color="#AF0000">TRADES</font> Model is designed to perform
transient load analysis by discrete event simulation in an integrated
evaluation system. It was designed to simulate message processing by
Sperry 1100/80 system but is fully adaptable to simulate any other
computer system. It is particularly useful to predict performance
under different dynamic loads. The input of messages into the model
is scenario based creating an environment similar to the user system.
The model gives extensive tabular and graphical outputs. It can
simulate cache disk. This paper was presented at the Spring 1984 USE
conference.
