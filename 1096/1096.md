The<font color="#AF0000"> MISCELLANEOUS UPLI UTILITIES </font>tape is
a collection of several small utilities that have been contributed to
UPLI. These include:


   
- DXQT is a program development aid that simplifies the mapping
       and execution of a program. (AMP)
       
       
- PRTT is a processor that can be used to list information about
       all or some of the elements in a program file. It is similar to
       the standard UNISYS (@PRT,T) but is more flexible and produces a
       more compact listing. PRTT is normally used from demand, but it
       can be used from batch if desired. (COS)
       
       
- RNG is a random number generator subroutine. Also included are
       sample programs in COBOL, FTN and MASM that call it. (AMP)
       
       
- SMQ is a program that accesses files on symbiont queues. Files
       may be read with CTS, ZIP, and FED.
       
       
- TIMARK is a program that allows you to determine the time or
       number of SUPs required to execute a program.
       
       
- TFUR/TREG - FREIPS CONVERSION ROUTINE was created to ease the
       migration from the TFUR and TREG utilities to the FREIPS utility.
       It takes your old source as input and makes all of the necessary
       conversion to work with the new FREIPS utility. After supplying
       the file name, the conversion routine will then search every
       element in that file for the keywords of TFUR and TREG. It will
       change the processor calls to FREIPS and change the format of the
       functions that follow these calls. The routine does not modify
       your original file. This routine must remain in ASCII format.
       (UUR)
