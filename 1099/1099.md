Included are processors that read Exec datastructures (PCT, MCT, MFD, unit table, symbiont queues), submitconsole keyins from batch jobs, update MFD attributes (MUSER$ cell,backup data), display English text for DMS and MCB error codes, showkeyins as they're typed at any console (including @@CONS), controlfile placement via extended acquire. Also included is a processorwritten in C using SLIB. Innovative techniques are used, such aspiping data between programs. A general-purpose pipeline subroutine(callable from MASM) is included.Two additional utility packages are included. CONLST and ALFP areASCII COBOL processors that report on the ASCII log Audit Trail(ALAT). AUTO is an SSG-based automated scheduling package withpowerful selection criteria for specifying when and how to performtasks such as starting batch jobs or submitting console keyins.&#13;&#13;- - -The files listed below may not be the most current.
