</font>is an implementation of the Iverson APL language as defined in
<i>APL Reference Manual</i>, by S. Pakin (Science Research
Associates) with some extensions.


Level 6.3 is upward compatible with and supersedes all previous
releases of UOM APL/1100. Level 6.3 includes all of the features of
the IBM XM6 release except that the representation function is not
yet defined for matrix arguments. In addition to support for
Teletypes, U100s, and DCT-500s, support for ASCII terminals with APL
character set is included.
