The UUSIG Program Index was developed to answer the frequently asked
question: "Is such-and-such program in the UUSIG Library?" Each
program is listed by name (alphabetically), followed by the package
number which contains it and a brief description.


Each program listing in the Program Index looks something like
this:

MFD</b> (#1051, June 1990![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG))
- @MFD (version 8.21) is a Master File Directory information
processor. Technical papers on it were presented at the Fall 1974
Toronto and Spring 1981 (New York City) USE Conferences. This
processor provides extensive file selection capabilities, and prints
a one-line summary for each file so selected. Totaling, sorting, and
sub-totaling features are provided, as is an optional SDF output
capability. Documentation included. (MSM 1978, REL 1990, ABS 1990)

The bold-lettered word is the program's name. MFD stands for Master
File Directory, but its acronym is MFD. The first item in parentheses
is the UUSIG package number in which the program can be found, #1051.
The second item is the date of the symbolic, relocatable or absolute
which has the latest creation date. The icon depicts what platform
the package is geared towards.


Following these is the actual description of the program as given
by the contributor. There are some packages for which no description
is available. The description gives you the pertinent information
about the program, and whether or not there is machine-readable
documentation (a separate documentation file) that accompanies the
program. After the description is another parenthesized section. This
contains one or more of the following codes:


   
- ABS = Absolute code
       
       
- ASM = Assembler
       
       
- BAS = BASIC programming language code
       
       
- C = C programming language code
       
       
- COB = COBOL programming language code
       
       
- ELT = Element (i.e. text)
       
       
- FOR = FORTRAN V programming language code
       
       
- FTN = ASCII FORTRAN programming code
       
       
- IPF = Interactive Processor Facility
       
       
- MSM = MASM, or Meta-Assembler
       
       
- PC = Personal Computer (IBM) package
       
       
- PL1 = PL1 programming language code
       
       
- PLS = PLUS programming language code
       
       
- REL = Relocatable code
       
       
- RID = Report Identifier (for MAPPER systems)
       
       
- SSG = Symbolic Stream Generator
       
       
- SYM = Symbolic code


These codes refer to the types of components that comprise the
total program package. The most common of these are ASM/MSM, REL and
ABS. The ASM and MSM codes refer to the actual source code for the
program, the code that the user/programmer can change. Both SYM and
ELT also refer to this type of code. The REL code refers to the
relocatable code (unlinked object code). ABS refers to the absolute,
executable program. Some packages have all of these while some
packages have only one or two. The date following each code denotes
the latest date that type of component was created (if different from
the date that follows the package number).
