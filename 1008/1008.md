<font color="#AF0000">SNOBOL</font> is a string manipulation language
especially well suited to the processing of non-numeric data. It
provides a powerful means for searching through arbitrary character
strings in order to find patterns, to rearrange the string and to
form new strings. <font color="#AF0000">SNOBOL</font> is especially
useful to those in the humanities and social sciences who could make
use of a computer in their research. Uncomplicated statement format,
string-oriented input-output editing aids, dynamic storage - all
those features enable researchers to devote their major efforts to
the problem at hand rather than to details in the programming
languages once they have mastered the first principles.


<font color="#AF0000">SNOBOL</font> has been used in conjunction
with research in a number of fields such as linguistics,
constructions of psychological models, cryptanalysis, music, theorem
proving, and developing of bibliographies, and indexes.
