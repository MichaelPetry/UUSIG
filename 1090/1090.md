<font color="#AF0000">CBSUBLIB</font> is a collection of MASM
routines, SSG and ECL runstreams, which together allow for the
development and productive use of ACOB subroutines in common banks.
In most cases the subroutines can be changed significantly without
having to re-collect the calling programs, resulting in lower
maintenance costs. <b>NOTE:</b> ACOB subroutines to be used with
<font color="#AF0000">CBSUBLIB</font> should follow certain
programming guidelines, which are described in accompanying
documentation. Subroutine access to RDMS 1100 and FMS-8 is a utility
to simplify and standardize the collection of ACOB programs. It can
be used in conjunction with <font color="#AF0000">CBSUBLIB</font> or
as a standalone utility.
