<font color="#AF0000">XREF</font> generates a cross-reference listing
of all entry points and undefined symbols in a specified program file
which must be PACK'ed, PREP'ed, and ASSIGNED. The names of the
relocatable elements are listed alphabetically. Beside each element
name, the names of all the relocatable elements in the program file
which reference this entry point are listed. An element entry point
is produced by the compiler or assembler; it specifies the location
at which the program element receives control or is otherwise
referenced.
