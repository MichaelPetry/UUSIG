<b>Q</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Gets you out of IPF. Same as the
LOGOFF command. (IPF)


<b>Q</b> ([1051](1099/INDEX.HTM), September
1993![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor
attaches @USE names and assigns each file in a symbiont queue (or
each symbiont file for a given run-id). This enables you to edit
PRINT$ files. Optionally, this processor will pipe this data to other
programs. Please read the comments at the top of this processor.
(MSM, ABS)


<b>QDISP</b> ([1051](1099/INDEX.HTM), September
1993![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This MASM processor
shows and periodically updates a screen displaying the first 19
entries on a symbiont queue. This is for demand runs only. (MSM, ABS)


<b>QED 2R3</b> ([1037](1037/INDEX.HTM), March
1980![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program will
allow a user to edit an SDF element or file in a quick and efficient
manner. Only one pass is made on input element and output element is
written as each line is passed. Documentation included. (ASM, ABS)


<b>QUAL</b> ([1051](1072/INDEX.HTM), November
1989![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Does @QUAL. (IPF)


<b>QUBIC</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), July
1074![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description
not available.(BAS)


<b>QUE</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.HTM), May 1986![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Attempts to figure out how many
pages the print file given in &lt;Spec 1&gt; contains. After telling
you, QUE will prompt for a device name to @SYM the print file to. To
exit QUE without@SYMing the print file, answer the device name prompt
with a blank transmit.(ABS)


<b>QUICKTPR 3R1</b> ([1037](1037/INDEX.HTM),
March 1980![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program will
print portions of an SDF print file. To determine which portions of a
file to print, the user specifies a set of character strings which
the program will compare against heading images in file. If a match
is found, the following data images will be printed until the next
heading control image is encountered. Many strings can be specified
(one per data card following the processor call). As each string is
matched, it is removed from further consideration (unless 'R' option
is specified). Documentation included. (ASM, ABS)


<b>QUIT</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Gets you out of IPF. Same as the
LOGOFF command. (IPF)
