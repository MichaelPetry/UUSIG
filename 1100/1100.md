The <font color="#AF0000">SBA COBOL Gen Utility</font> (@GEN) was
written to dynamically generate COBOL precompile, compile and/or map
ECL to meet the current needs of every SBA COBOL program.


COBOL-85 (UCOB) provides various date conversion functions which
were lacking in COBOL-74 (ACOB). JDNSUB makes these capabilities
available for the ACOB environment. The integer number of days since
December 31, 1600 (Gregorian calendar) is used as an intermediate
between YYYYMMDD and YYYYDDD formats. It can also be used as a date
compression routine. A listing of the source code will be presented
and explained, as well as the procedure used to validate its
correctness over the range of 1601 thru 3000 AD.
