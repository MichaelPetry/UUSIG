The <font color="#AF0000">Batch Scheduler </font>is a system which
selects and starts batch jobs from a master schedule. The RSI$
interface is used to start jobs as though they had originated from
the system console. A number of selection criteria are available. A
start time, account and userid are required input. Project id and set
value are optional. A clearance level must be provided if the Exec is
configured with security on. The system consists of three programs:
(1) the Schedule Maker selects and schedules the jobs and prints the
daily schedule; (2) the Starter starts the jobs periodically
throughout the day; and (3) the Operations Override provides a tool
for Operations to make adjustments to the daily scheduled. <font color="#AF0000">Batch Scheduler </font>is compatible with ASCII
FORTRAN 11R1C.
