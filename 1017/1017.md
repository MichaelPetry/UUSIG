This processor provides the programmer with an effective tool for
viewing and modifying the contents of Exec 8 program files. <font color="#AF0000">VPF</font> will access any or all elements by
scanning the program file element table. It was written in 1100
Assembler under Version 31.244 and occupies 3K of memory.


DEMAND MODE: When <font color="#AF0000">VPF</font> is executed in
demand mode, interactive commands allow the programmer to perform the
following operations:


   
- Mark an element for deletion.
    
       
- Recover an element previously marked for deletion.
    
       
- Print the contents of symbolic elements.
    
       
- Locate specific elements.


BATCH MODE: <font color="#AF0000">VPF</font> will list all or
selected elements from a program file. The programmer may limit the
number of lines to be printed from symbolic elements.
