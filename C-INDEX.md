<b>CACHECHK</b> ([1082](1082/INDEX.md), July
1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Cache Recovery/Checking System is a utility
that aids in CACHE RECOVERY situations. CACHECHK will scan all (or
specified) TIP files for current status. CACHECHK will optionally
perform certain TIP functions on CACHE-DISABLED TIP files, such as
Enabling, TPASGing and setting the LEG DNR. CACHECHK also generates
SGS images for user written skels. CACHECHK will now TPASG any file
that is TPFREE'd, not just the files that were cache disabled. (MSM,

combined compiler and execution environment,capable of running CALL
programs interpretively or saving them as complete absolutes for
later, independent execution. CALL is an excellent tool for writing
one-time programs and prototyping utilities. Where performance is not
absolutely critical, CALL programs can be used successfully in
production environments. Documentation included. (ABS, ELT, MSM)

<b>CONLST</b> ([1051](1099/INDEX.md), September
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This COBOL processor is used to recreate
CONSOLE listings by scanning the ASCII LOG for type 203 entries. A
help screen will be displayed if called with the H option or no
options. When a time frame to report on is specified the CONLST

frame. It uses the SLRR selection routines to select the cycles of
the ASCII LOG which contain the time frame requested and reports on
the complete cycle(s) of the ASCII LOG. (COB,ABS)


<b>CONS</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), January

console keyins (done by MCC and by users). Replies to outstanding
messages (messages whose format is 'O-message'.), and all console
type output directed either to MCC or a user's terminal. Some console
output messages are used for logging purposes only and only appear in
the console log file mentioned above (and are not directed to any
terminal). (MSM, ABS)


<b>CONSOLE-CCR</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), May
1982![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(MSM 1982,
ABS 1981).

1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - ASCII to Fieldata Log Converter. This program
was written as an expedient: in order to use EXEC 40R2 or higher, UOM
had to be able to process the new format (ASCII) log files.
Documentation included. (PLS, REL, ABS)


<b>CONVERT</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), July
1978![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Designed to convert constants in assembly

1985![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Used to copy OS1100 Word-Addressable files to
and from magnetic tape. SLC CSF does not have the source for this
program so it is being supplied as Absolute-Only. No documentation is
available for this program. (ABS)


<b>COPYWAD</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), February
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The program COPYWAD copies word-addressable
files. The program reads and writes 1792-word blocks(track-size I/O).
The "IN" and "OUT" files may be word-addressable,sector-addressable,
or tape, in any of the 9 combinations. A message gives the number of
tracks read/written. This count does not include the EOF-block on
tape. Note that these tape files are not compatible with @COPY,G
block sizes.Documentation included. (ABS)


<b>CPA</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), September
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Changes the project/account of the file on
the processor call to the second and third fields, respectively on
the call. (ELT)


<b>CPD</b> ([1042](1042/INDEX.md), May 1980![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - COPY-DUMP is an enhancement of the DPDMPH
processor, allowing the user to duplicate, compare, position, and
print tape files, copy to FASTRAND, and print FASTRAND files. The
file utility processor (@CPD), which acts on user command cards,
performs on filename(s) and possibly the number of records or files
to be processed under the command cards. This processor will handle
ASCII data. (ASM, REL, ABS)


<b>CPMD</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.md), February
1989![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The Conversational Post Mortem Dump(CPMD)
processor is designed to aid the terminal user in detecting the
causes of program failure. Whenever a program terminates, a copy of
its core image is dumped by the 1100 EXECUTIVE to a file for possible
post-processing. CPMD is a program to selectively examine this dump
interactively. Register dumps and dumps in specified formats (such as
integer or INSTRUCTION) are allowed. CPMD normally looks at the
current contents of the dump file which is named DIAG$.To initiate
examination of the dump, type @CPMD. CPMD will respond with a signon
line and list the IBANK and DBANK limits of the program being
dumped.CPMD then solicits a command by typing a single asterisk.

<b>CRUN</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), January
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Console/Runstream Interface
Processor.Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)

<b>CSG</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), October
1984![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Compile Stream Generator. A simple program to

and an @MAP of the element specified on the processor call.(ABS)


<b>CSHELL</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), September
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - CSHELL is a program which provides a shell
around the OS1100 Exec Control Language (ECL) for demand users.
CSHELL provides the user with the ability to create a working
environment tailored to their liking. The user has control over every
command entered. In addition to this powerful capability, CSHELL
comes with a complement of time saving and useful features and
processors. CSHELL has a UNIX C-shell flavor with its main features
including: * ALIASING: This allows one to alias any command or
multiple commands to a new command name of their choice. * HISTORY
BUFFER: Each command which is entered is saved in a buffer and can be
displayed or reexecuted at any point. * REDIRECTION: An easy way to
redirect the output of any command or multiple commands to a file or
element. * PIPES: Used to redirect the output from one command as
input to another file. * SEARCHPATH:One can define a path of program
files to search for a particular processor to execute (similar to
paths used by UNIX and MS-DOS). * And much much more including
internal processors such as the decimal/octal calculator, GREP (used
to search for strings), SCRIPTS, and extensive documentation. (SYM,

1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This generic processor (see GENERIC
PROCESSOR) displays information about what f-cycles of a file exist.
It provides a better display than the FURPUR @CYCLE command. @CYC is
a good example of pipelining and generic processing. It gets its MFD
data from @MFDPL. Used with CYC/ADD. (MSM, SSG, ABS)


<b>CYCLE</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the @CYCLE ECL command.(IPF)
