This is a set of programs to read the ASCII System Log and prepare a
billing tape. Version 3 adds new features to the programs contained
in this package. Program LOG40-COPY uses SLRR to read log records and
write selected record types to an output SDF file. Program
LOG40-MERGE merges SDF log data to create consolidated log files
(e.g., weekly or monthly). Program L40BIL-SDF reads a log file in SDF
format and creates an IBM format billing tape. Program BILREP reads
the billing tape and produces a summary report. Program LOGMFDX
accumulates cataloged tape and disk existence units. ASCII Log
Programs is compatible with EXEC 41R3 and SLRR (2R1 or above).
