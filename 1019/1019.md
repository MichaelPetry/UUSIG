The <font color="#AF0000">COBOL Instrumentation Package </font>(<font color="#AF0000">CIP</font>) may be used as a program flow validating
tool as well as a vehicle through which program efficiency may be
evaluated. The <font color="#AF0000">CIP</font> system instruments a
user supplied COBOL program in such a manner that upon execution of
the instrumented program a statistical data record is created.
through the <font color="#AF0000">CIP</font> output report, which is
based upon the statistical data record, the user obtains information
which reveals the frequency of logical path execution as well as
execution time and the percentage of total program execution time for
each paragraph.


<font color="#AF0000">CIP</font> may also be used in program flow
validation. A statement execution count is listed for each statement
of the program. This information may be used to determine what
portion of the program has actually been exercised during testing.
Test data can be altered where necessary so that a more comprehensive
test can be developed.
