TIME stands for "Total Information MAPPER Environment." It is an
electronic filing system, electronic mail, and a series of powerful
commands for all levels of MAPPER users (end users, run writers, and
coordinators). Its purpose is to give these users more control over
their environment. A talk on "TIME" was given at the FALL '84, USE
conference in San Diego.
