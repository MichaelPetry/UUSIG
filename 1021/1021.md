<font color="#AF0000">PLUM</font> is a compiler, develops at the
University of Maryland, for the PL/1 language. PL/1 is a powerful
programming language that combines the computational power of a
language like FORTRAN with the file processing capabilities of a
language like COBOL. In addition, the full range of string and
arithmetic operators and functions, as well as the concise logical
program structure, make it a very convenient language in which to
program.


<font color="#AF0000">PLUM</font> has the following
characteristics:


   
- It is extremely efficient. Over 100 statements per second can
       be compiled on a 1108.
    
       
- <font color="#AF0000">PLUM</font> produces absolute machine
       code, this no collection step is necessary. This increases, even
       further, the efficiency of the compiler compared to a standard
       compiler which produces relocatable output.
    
       
- Many diagnostic aids are built into the <font color="#AF0000">PLUM</font> system, thus making <font color="#AF0000">PLUM</font> an integrated program developement and
       evaluation system, as well as simply a very fast compiler.
       Programs may be debugged by accessing program variables by name,
       rather than by octal location. There is never any need to resort
       to machine language debugging techniques.
