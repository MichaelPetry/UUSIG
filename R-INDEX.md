<b>RAT</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), April 1979![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Quite often a tape may magically
appear from some unknown site, consisting of some unknown quantity of
unknown data.It could be any density or parity and who knows what
character code it was written in. This processor has been written to
help alleviate the mystery.Why @RAT? Because it "reads a tape."
Documentation included. (SYM,ABS)


<b>RBCOM</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), March
1989![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Reads two relocatable
elements and determines if they are the same or different. The
output, in the case where some differences are found, attempt to lead
you in a direction of discovering the source of the differences.
(ABS)


<b>RBDUMP</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), March
1992![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Lists summary
information about a specific Relocatable Element. This includes: *
element attributes and starting address * the final value of each
location counter * external definitions(exported references) *
external references (imported references). Documentation included.
(ABS)


<b>RC</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), January
1989![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works together with
several other processors (B, E, C, P, and S) as a sophisticated
system to breakpoint output,call editors to examine the output and
direct the output of print queues.(ELT)


<b>RCS</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), August
1989![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Run Control System
interface program. Called as a processor without options it 'checks
in' with the run control system to register a run's progress. The 1
to 6 character parameter is the task name (which can be viewed with
the RC keyin in the 'TASK=' field). (MSM,ABS)


<b>RCW</b> ([1065](1065/INDEX.md), March
1989![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor prints
the current value of the run condition word. Documentation included.
(ELT, FTN, REL,ABS)


<b>RD</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the DOS RD (remove
directory)command. (IPF)


<b>READCOLUTAPE</b> ([1056](1056/INDEX.md),
April 1985![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A KERMIT tape routine.
This ECL compiles the COBOL program ANSID and the MASM subroutine
H18510, collects them together and then executes the resulting
absolute to load a KERMIT release tape, ANSID format. (ELT)


<b>READLG 1R10</b> ([1037](1037/INDEX.md), March
1980![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Subroutine to read
next data log entry with given criteria (Pre-ASCII log file).
Documentation included. (ASM,REL)


<b>READPCT</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), August
1981![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description
not available.(ELT)


<b>RELEASE</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), March
1988![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - To release the unused
space in a file (the difference between the HIGHEST TRACK WRITTEN and
HIGHEST GRANULE ASG-D as seen in the @PRT,F display), do an @RELEASE
filename. (MSM, ABS)


<b>RELOAD</b> ([1049](1049/INDEX.md), June
1982![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - RELOAD displays all
available back updates for files (including ARCHIVE copies) and
allows users to choose recovery dates. Recovery is completely
automated. The system includes programs for building a database of
backups. The system was described at the Spring 1982 USE Conference.
Documentation included. (ELT, ABS)


<b>RELOAD</b> ([1079](1079/INDEX.md), April
1991![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The RELOAD processor
replaces and enhances the standard ROLBAK function, providing a
faster, more orderly, and more flexible restoration of unloaded
files. RELOAD also allows users to monitor the queue of files
scheduled for restoration and to place in the queue file that have
been archived or otherwise deleted from the Master File Directory.
The File Database processor (FDB) gives users access to a database
containing information on all currently available SECURE/FAS backup
tapes and the files that they contain. Documentation included. (MSM,
REL,ABS)


<b>RESTORE</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), August
1985![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The RESTORE processor
is used to mark an OS1100 cataloged file "unloaded" and then assign
it. This action causes a ROLLBACK of the file thereby restoring that
file to the state of the last save.Documentation and source (MASM)
are included. (MSM, REL, ABS)


<b>RID ARCHIVAL</b> ([1074](1074/INDEX.md),
January 1990![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)![[MAPPER]](IMAGES/MAPPER.JPG)) - Uses File Manager (see File
Manager) System to control the archival of MAPPER rids to tape. User
can request archive, reload, or delete archived rids. (RIDs)


<b>RIGHT</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May
1990![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the
MVS/ISPF RIGHT command.(IPF)


<b>RLCB</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), June
1986![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A runstream and a
program used to reload defined sets of AFCBs (Alternate File Common
Banks). Call is @RLCB and BDIs to reload are input as data images.
The runstream solicits the console for the name of the set of
predefined common banks to reload. (MSM, ABS)


<b>RM</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the UNIX rm (remove
file) command.(IPF)


<b>ROCULL</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), March
1992![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Produces a cull of
Relocatables and/or Dap Omnibuses in a given file. Documentation
included. (ABS)


<b>RUNINFO$</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), October
1990![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Generates SGS-able PCT
and system information. Documentation included. (MSM, ABS)


<b>RUNS 2R5</b> ([1037](1037/INDEX.md), March
1980![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program will display
start and end times of specified run-id starting at specific time.
The information comes from the system log or the file 'LOG$' if
assigned to run. Pre-ASCII Log File. Documentation included. (ASM,
ABS)
