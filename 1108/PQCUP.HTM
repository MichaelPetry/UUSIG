<H1>1. 'PQCUP' (Print Queue Clean-Up)</H1>

<H2>1.1. Introduction</H2>

<P>The PQCUP processor is used to maintain the symbiont queues on
your system. The main reason PQCUP has been written is to selectively
get rid of print files which have been queued for printing but are no
longer required.</P>

<P>Please report any problems or suggestions to:</P>

<H2>1.2. Processor Call</H2>

<P>The general PQCUP processor call syntax is:</P>

<P><TT>@[&lt;file.&gt;]PQCUP[,&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;primary sel.
specs&gt;],[&lt;secondary sel. specs&gt;]<BR>

</TT><BR>

As the above syntax indicates, all options and specification fields
are optional and will have default values assigned, if necessary.
</P>

<P>The various specification fields are described in the following
subsections.</P>

<H3>1.2.1 File</H3>

<P>This is the file in which PQCUP is stored and is not required to
be specified if PQCUP has been installed and registered in a system
library file.</P>

<H3>1.2.2 Options</H3>

<P>Options can be categorized into the following three groups:</P>

<P>General options:</P>

<P>C - Do not error terminate, even if an error occurs. This applies
to non-internal and non-serious errors only.</P>

<P>Z - If debugging is enabled within the program, this option
produces diagnostic dumps at several key points in the program. If
debugging is disabled this option is invalid.</P>

<P>Action options:</P>

<P>D - Delete the selected print files. When this option is used the
J-option is assumed, if not specified.</P>

<P>L - List the selected print file entries. This is the default
option if no other action option has been specified.</P>

<P>U - Update (toggle) the In-Progress and/or SV bit of the selected
entries. This option requires at least one of the selection option
and produces two lines of output per entry. The first line displays
the original entry (before the change) and the second line displays
the updated entry (after the change).</P>

<P>Selection options:</P>

<P>I - Select entries with the In-Progress bit set only.</P>

<P>J - Bypass entries with the In-Progress bit set.</P>

<P>S - Select entries with the SV bit set only.</P>

<P>T - Bypass entries with the SV bit set.</P>

<P>When more than one of the selection options are given, all tests
must pass for the entry to be selected, provided it is a legal option
combination (logical 'AND' operations are done).</P>

<H3>1.2.3 Specification Fields</H3>

<P>The specification fields are used to specify further selection
criteria for print files to be searched for. Two types of
specification fields are available: Primary selection specifications
and secondary selection specifications. If neither selection options
nor specification fields are given, PQCUP defaults to all print files
queued on the system.</P>

<H4>1.2.3.1 Primary Selection Specifications</H4>

<P>Primary selection specs are the parameters which PQCUP passes on
to the operating system and, in turn, retrieves only the entries
which match the specified criteria. The format is:</P>

<P>&lt;name&gt;/&lt;identifier&gt;</P>

<P>where: name refers to an EXEC entity of the following identifier
</P>

<P>identifier describes the name above and can be:</P>

<P>QUEUE Print queue identifier</P>

<P>RUNID Generated runid</P>

<P>USERID Userid</P>

<P>OUTPUT-ID Output-id of in-progress print files</P>

<P>PRIORITY Priority value (A - Z)</P>

<P>FILE File name</P>

<P>The above described identifiers can be abbreviated to any length.
On the first specification field it can be omitted and defaults to
QUEUE or FILE, respectively. This has been implemented to allow easy
access to various print queues (@PQCUP B12, for example).</P>

<P>All of the specified identifiers must match for an entry to be
selected (logical 'AND' operations are done). The only exception to
this rule is when multiple print queue ids have been specified to be
searched. In this case, only one of the queue ids must match. The
actual number of allowed print queue id specs is configurable and is
currently set to a maximum of 10.</P>

<P>If the identifier is RUNID or OUTPUT-ID and name is not specified,
the generated runid of the calling run is assumed.</P>

<P>If the identifier refers to a userid and name is omitted, the
current userid is substituted.</P>

<P>When the qualifier part of a file name is not specified, the run's
default qualifier is used (@QUAL,D).</P>

<P>When the qualifier is omitted but an asterisk precedes the
filename the run's implied qualifier is used (@QUAL).</P>

<P>When the file cycle is omitted the first print file found on the
queue(s) which match the specified qualifier and file name is
selected, regardless of the actual file cycle.</P>

<P>Summarizing the rules outlined above gives the following syntax:
</P>

<P><TT>[&lt;device-1&gt;[/QUEUE],[&lt;device-n&gt;/QUEUE]],;</TT>
</P>

<P><TT>[[&lt;run-id&gt;]/RUNID],;</TT></P>

<P><TT>[[&lt;user-id&gt;]/USERID],;</TT></P>

<P><TT>[[&lt;output-id&gt;]/OUTPUT-ID],;</TT></P>

<P><TT>[&lt;priority&gt;/PRIORITY],;</TT></P>

<P><TT>[&lt;qual&gt;[*]]&lt;file&gt;[(cyc)].[/FILE] </TT></P>

<H4>1.2.3.2 Secondary Selection Specifications</H4>

<P>Secondary selection specs are selection parameters not supported
by the operating system directly. Thus, PQCUP retrieves the entries
specified via the primary selection specs and reselects the desired
entries.</P>

<P>This specification, if used, must be the last field on the
processor call line. If this is the only field, it must be made
unique by using the test-operator or date identifier field, otherwise
it would be recognized as a primary spec field print queue or file
name.</P>

<P>Currently, only one secondary selection spec is implemented which
allows to select files based on their relative age. The specification
field format is:</P>

<P><TT>[&lt;test-operator&gt;.][&lt;relative age&gt;][/&lt;date
ident&gt;]<BR>

</TT><BR>

where: test-operator is an optional field used to specify the test to
be done against the relative age specification, which selects the
files based on the number of days since cataloged or number of days
last referenced, respectively.</P>

<P>Valid test operators are:</P>

<P>TGE (Test Greater or Equal) TG (Test Greater) TE (Test Equal) TNE
(Test Not Equal) TLE (Test Less than or Equal) TNG (Test Not Greater)
</P>

<P>If this specification is omitted TGE is assumed, which causes all
file entries to be selected older than or equal to the number of days
specified in the relative age specification field.</P>

<P>relative age specifies the relative age in days of file entries to
be selected. It can be omitted with the LIST function only and
defaults to 0 in this case. For all other functions this
specification is mandatory. The test to be performed depends on the
test-operator specification described above.</P>

<P>date ident specifies which date to use to determine the print
file's age.</P>

<P>Print files put on a symbiont queue do not have a field attached
which tells the date the file has been symmed. To work around this
gap, PQCUP offers the capability to refer either to the date the file
has been cataloged or the last reference date of the file to
determine it's relative age.</P>

<P>Valid choices for this field are CATAGE or REFAGE. When it's not
specified, CATAGE is the default.</P>

<P>See section "Restrictions" for further details on this subject.
</P>

<H2>1.3. Current Restrictions and Limitations</H2>

<H3>1.3.1 Maximum Number Of Print Queue Entries</H3>

<P>Due to current (44R3) Exec limitations, PQCUP can only handle up
to 169 print queue entries at most. However, when the D-option is
used to delete entries, it could be possible for PQCUP to process all
entries on a queue, even if there are more than 169 entries queued.
Actually, the degree of success depends on the primary selection
specs, i.e. the matching of the file entries against the user's
specifications.</P>

<P>Suppose there are 300 entries on a symbiont queue. PQCUP reads the
first 169 entries and examines each one to determine which ones match
the user-specified selection criteria. Let's assume that there have
been 3 entries selected for deletion. When these entries have been
successfully removed PQCUP recognizes that there are more entries
queued and initiates another read request to retrieve the first 169
entries again. If the queue has not been changed by any other
activity, there are 3 new entries in the set of the first 169
entries. The other 166 ones have already been read in the previous
execution path.</P>

<P>The user should be aware though that this processing is very
inefficient, it does allow the removal of more than 169 print files,
provided there is at least one entry which matches the primary
selection specification.</P>

<H3>1.3.2 Date Of @SYM</H3>

<P>The Exec does not carry the date a file has been symmed along with
the symbiont queue entries, so it's not possible to refer to the date
a file has been symmed. To get around this gap, PQCUP refers to the
date the file has been cataloged. Optionally, this default value can
be overwritten to refer to the last reference date of the file.
However, using the last-reference date it should be remembered that
if a user referenced the file while DLOC$-privileged, the file's
last-reference date is not updated.</P>

<H2>1.4. Notes</H2>

<H3>1.4.1 Changes To The System Clock</H3>

<P>When PQCUP executes and a date change occurs (either manually
initiated or automatically at midnight), PQCUP continues to use the
date it has been invoked to determine the relative dates of the print
files. In other words, the date used as a basis to calculate the
relative date is determined at program initialization and
subsequently reused.</P>

<H3>1.4.2 The Sign-Off Line</H3>

<P>When PQCUP terminates, it normally displays a sign-off line in the
following format:</P>

<P><TT>END PQCUP. Examined: a/b Listed: c Changed: d Deleted: e
Rejected: f<BR>

</TT><BR>

where:</P>

<P>a Number of entries returned by the operating system on the LAST
retrieve operation.</P>

<P>b Total number of entries at the time of the LAST retrieve
operation.</P>

<P>c The number of files that have been listed, i. e. displayed.</P>

<P>d The number of entries updated.</P>

<P>e The number of entries removed.</P>

<P>f The number of entries that have not been processed due to any of
the following errors encountered:</P>

<P>- An error occurred reading the MFD information of a file<BR>

- The In-progress bit could not be set for an entry<BR>

- The entry could not be removed<BR>

- The Exec marked the entry in error</P>

<P>When a file is marked rejected or any other unusual situation is
encountered a snapshot dump and/or formatted dump is displayed,
depending on the type of error.</P>

<H3>1.4.3 System Log Entries For Deleted Print Files</H3>

<P>When a print file is being dropped via ER SMOQUE$, the Exec
assigns it to it's PCT and finally marks it for deletion. Therefore,
Exec is recorded in the system log file entry as the deleting
activity, regardless of the initiator. Unfortunately, there is no way
to determine the originating activity which actually initiated the
delete request.</P>

<P>I have opened a Feature Suggestion on this subject, but haven't
received an answer yet.</P>

<H3>1.4.4 Privileges And File Security</H3>

<P>To access, modify and delete print files PQCUP uses various ER
SMOQUE$ functions. Access to some of these functions is restricted,
and only users with appropriate privileges can use them. The type of
required privileges depends on the system configuration:</P>

<P>On systems running Fundamental Security only the security officer
has the rights to use privileged ER SMOQUE$ functions.</P>

<P>On systems with Secopt-1 or higher turned on the calling user has
to have the SSSMOQUE privilege to use the privileged ER SMOQUE$
functions. The security officer grants these privileges to individual
users.</P>

<P>However, a user with access to the privileged ER SMOQUE$ functions
bypasses all file security checks. Even in a Secopt-1 or higher
system, delete access is granted to ALL files, not only to the files
within the user's compartment set or clearance level range, as one
might assume.</P>

<P>I have opened a Feature Suggestion on this subject, but haven't
received an answer yet.</P>

<H2>1.5. Planned Enhancements For Future Releases</H2>

<UL>
   <LI>Detailed and meaningful messages on spec field errors
   
   <LI>Attach use-names to the selected print files (if no D-option)
   
   <LI>Copy / move the selected files into program file elements
</UL>

<H2>1.6. Release History</H2>

<P>- Sep '95 1R1 Initial release</P>

<H2>1.7. Examples</H2>

<P>Each of the following examples shows at least two possible PQCUP
calls. The first one shows the full spelled out syntax, and any
following calls are abbreviated calls which deliver the same results.
Additionally, all examples assume that PQCUP has been either
installed in a system library file or copied into the run's TPF$
file.</P>

<P>List all print files on the system.</P>

<P><TT>@PQCUP,L TGE.0/CATAGE</TT></P>

<P><TT>@PQCUP</TT></P>

<P>List all print files on the system on queue B12 which have been
created 30 days or longer ago.</P>
