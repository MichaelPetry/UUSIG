The <font color="#AF0000">CALC</font> processor allows a Uniscope 100
terminal to be used as a programmable desk calculator. No programming
knowledge is needed for its use. It is written in FORTRAN V and 1100
assembler under Version 31.244 and occupies 10K of memory.


There are three types of <font color="#AF0000">CALC</font>
instructions: interactive arithmetic operations; interactive
application of FORTRAN V and <font color="#AF0000">CALC</font>
functions; and, creation and application if user defined functions
which are stored as symbolic elements in a Exec 8 program file.


The six <font color="#AF0000">CALC</font> subroutines provide a
powerful and useful set of tools which allow FORTRAN and COBOL
programs to easily manipulate the contents of program files and
retrieve data from the INFOR table.
