The <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> processor is used to
conversationally edit the table of contents of a program file. It
allows all or portions of the table of contents to be edited, program
elements to be deleted, and any elements deleted after the last @PACK
of the file to be recovered. The <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font>
command structure is modeled on the original @ED text editor. All of
the @ED commands have not been implemented, (INSERT, APPEND, etc.)
and some of the <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> commands are
unique (e.g., SAVE). However, users familiar with @ED commands should
find <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> easy to learn.

New features in 9R4 are:


   - The FC and LC commands now support the '*' and ',' formats.
   See the 'FIND AND COUNT' and 'LOCATE AND COUNT' command
   documentation for details.

   - A new mode has been added: MFD. Users may now examine the
   Master File Directory via the MFD and MFD! commands.

   - In conjunction with the new MFD mode, users may now switch to
   another file via the TOC! command.

   - A new ON/OFF mode, ROLLBK, has been added for use with the
   TOC! command.

   - While in MFD mode, users may request information about a file
   similar to that supplied by the @PRT,F command. See the SHOW
   command for details.

   - The ELT command will now work on ABSOLUTE elements. Entering
   ELT on an absolute element will show a map of the relocatable
   elements which built the absolute.

   - <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> can now be directed to
   start in the Assembler, COBOL, or FORTRAN procedure tables, the
   Entry Point Table, or the Master File Directory instead of the
   Table of Contents. See the 'Processor Call Options' section for
   details.


New features in 9R6 are:


   - The FILE command was added.


New features in 10R0 are:


   - A bug triggered by long lines in elements was corrected.

   - <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> will now operate on SDF
   (PRINT$, etc.) files.

   - A new ON/OFF mode, ECHO, was added.

   - A new ON/OFF mode, LONG, was added.

   - The SHOW command was enhanced to allow ranges of files to be
   displayed.

   - The VERBOSE command was added. This essentially replaces the
   SHOW command, which was retained for compatibility.

   - The TFUR and TREG modes were added, along with the related
   update commands (REG, DREG, TPASG, TPFREE, RV, CG, etc.)


New features in 10R3 are:


   - <font color="#AF0000">TOCED</font> is now compatible with BSP$
   for SB5R2+. This includes limited support for the large program
   file (LPF) format.

   - The VERBOSE file display now shows the file owner.

   - The TOC display now distinguishes between ABSOLUTE, ZOOM,
   OBJ-MODULE, and BOUND-OM element types.

   - The QUE commands allow access to the system print queues.

   - In QUE mode, the FILE command will switch to the queued
   file.

   - In MFD or QUE mode, the FILE command now accepts line
   numbers.

   - The VERBOSE command works in QUE mode.

   - The HELP command was added.
