<font color="#AF0000">GPSS</font> is intended for simulation of
discrete systems. The simulation is based on Monte-Carlo techniques
since one can usually specify the input to the system, its behavior,
or both, in stochastic terms. The output is a set of statistics which
describe the interactions between system components in probabilistic
terms.
