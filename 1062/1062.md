<font color="#AF0000">SIPMON</font> and <font color="#AF0000">DEARSIP</font> are separate but very closely related
software products designed for use by performance evaluation as well
as capacity planning analysts.


<font color="#AF0000">SIPMON</font> consists of a group of ECL and
executable programs which drive the system software monitor; evaluate
system performance on a dynamic basis according to user-defined
parameters; and maintain an historical data base of SIP information
(PMF). <font color="#AF0000">SIPMON</font> functions in a batch
environment and is designed to execute continuously (24 hours/day, 7
days/week).


<font color="#AF0000">DEARSIP</font> is an interactive program
designed to access a (PMF) performance master file (created via <font color="#AF0000">SIPMON</font>) to produce user-defined reports and
graphs, as well as pre-designed full screen reports covering major
operating system components. The user can access 322 predefined
variables and can also define up to 50 locally described variables of
information.
