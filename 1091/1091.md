On the 1100/2200 systems, printouts are generated when processing
runstreams. These printouts, called PRINT$ files, consume much paper
and require handling by humans. Frederick and Nelson developed <font color="#AF0000">LOOKPRINT$</font>, a MAPPER based application for
providing on-line access and processing of PRINT$ files. Frederick
and Nelson has reported many benefits from this system, including the
elimination of millions of pages of paper, immediate access to the
PRINT$ upon completion of a runstream, remote access for programmers
who are "on call," and automatic extraction of information from
PRINT$ files. <font color="#AF0000">LOOKPRINT$</font> is compatible
with MAPPER 35R1 or higher.
