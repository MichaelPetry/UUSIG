<font color="#AF0000">COSLOP2</font> is a FORTRAN V program which
simulates the development of slope profiles as process-response
systems. By varying the combinations of processes, and by varying the
quantitative parameters that govern the operations of each process,
it is possible to adapt the model program to a very great variety of
tectonic, climatic, and lithological conditions, and thus to simulate
slope development in different environments. The model is
particularly useful for analyzing the effect of specific processes
and process combinations upon the slope form, for testing the
plausibility of hypotheses of slope development, and for
investigating the functional interaction of the form and process
component the together make up the slope system.
