The MAPPER Automated Data Base Purge Utility is a series of runs that
replace the Primer/Killer runs. Designed by the MAPPER coordination
department at Wardair, the increased functionality over Primer/Killer
includes sorted reports, and the ability for the users to respond on-
line to save rids that are delete candidates.
