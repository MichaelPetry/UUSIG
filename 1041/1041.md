The <font color="#AF0000">SPLITASG</font> utility allows the user to
split a large multi-volume tape file into several smaller temporary
tape files with a subset of the volumes. One possible use would be to
create several sorts instead of one big one so to require less
recovery time and decrease the overhead of a huge sort on system
resources. Another use would be the segregating of a single volume
for use with several available dump utilities that do not have the
capability of processing multi-volume tape files.
