<font color="#AF0000">FORFLO</font> is an Automatic FORTRAN Flowchart
Generator which creates from any FORTRAN program a computer drawn
flowchart suitable for display on a high- speed printer. The
flowchart produced adheres as closely as possible to standard
flowchart symbols.


The flowchart is one-dimensional, utilizing down-the-page flow and
it shows 'Do' nesting and branching or 'Goto' lines. The flowcharts
generated require no intervention on the programmer's part unless
altered output is desired.


The flowcharts produced by <font color="#AF0000">FORFLO</font> can
be very useful in areas such as training, debugging, and
documentation. <font color="#AF0000">FORFLO</font> is dependent on
the statement structure as defined by the FORTRAN language. Each
statement is analyzed and classified, then processed with associated
information. After this procedure has been completed for all the
source code of the element, the processed information is read and the
flowchart generated.
