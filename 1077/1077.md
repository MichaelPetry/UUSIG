<font color="#AF0000">Nifty IPF 1100 Procedures</font> was
presented at the Spring 1990 Nashville Conference by Randy Carpenter
of GSU. This package contains very useful, general-purpose utilities
that provide some of the functionality of the DOS, UNIX, VM/XEDIT and
CTS environments. Furthermore, several full-screen FORM procedures
are provided. The procedures are fully documented and come with their
own on-line HELP system. Nifty IPF 1100 Procedures is compatible with
EXEC 39, IPF 5R1 and DPS 4R1.
