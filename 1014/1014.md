The <font color="#AF0000">SAVESECURE</font> processor is a program
designed to save as much content as possible from a SECURE tape in
poor condition. The processor reads the tape and builds a copy of it
which is satisfactory for use by the SECURE processor. The new tape
contains all the files that were in good condition on the original
tape. The processor may also be used to selectively dump a SECURE
tape.
