<b>ZIP</b> ([1088](1088/INDEX.HTM), June 1993
<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - <font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> is a fast, powerful SDF file
processor,written by Ward Condit who won the 1990 UPLI Contribution
Award with MARS(#1080), that replaces and enhances most of the
functions of of @ED,R and can outperform it by a factor of ten or
more. Approximately 10,000 tracks per minute can be processed on an
1100/90 with 8470 discs. In addition to its speed, <font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> features: an internal line index that
allows almost instant access to any record that has been read before;
large record support (up to 2047 words); low intensity/reverse video
display of control character sequences so they can be observed
without screen corruption; and ability to extract and reformat fixed
portions of data records, including numerical representation of
computational fields; ability to preselect a subset of records based
on fixed field contents prior to display, locate,extract functions.
It incorporates FUSION simulated full-screen processing from CAA
(available separately from UPLI, catalog
[1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), for use with other software,
such as Unisys' @ED processor). Release 2R1 has the ability to
process a raw ASCII log as if it was SDF formatted. Each record is
edited into a compressed standard format that includes the most
commonly used information. The "find address" commands make it easy
to locate data in a PMD format dump,and REFORMAT has some new
capabilities. Release 2R1 is totally upward-compatible with 1R2D.
Full source code is included with this release.


Release 3R1 allows you to save and restore symbol definitions
across sessions. Output files and elements can now be sorted before
being written. There are new commands (IF, ELSE and IFEND) which
allow selective execution depending on the "find" or "no find" status
from the last LOCATE or FIND. Two new field types have been defined
(unsigned and signed packed numeric) which operate the same as the
original &lt;UC&gt; and &lt;SC&gt; except that leading zeros are
omitted. And level 3R1 has a built-in HELP facility. (MSM,ABS)


<b>ZORK</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.HTM), January 1983
<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This is an FTN version of
MIT's ZORK("DUNGEON") game. <font color="#AF0000">ZORK</font> starts
where ADVENTURE and CAVE (see above for both)leave off: it allows
more expressive input commands, and more complex relationships
between objects in the game. Documentation included.(ABS)
