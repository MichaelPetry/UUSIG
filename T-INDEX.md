1985<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - MASM program signs
on as an RJE,takes all print files in that queue, and places them as
elements in a program file. To take care of TIP dumps, it checks

(ABS)

**TOCED** ([1087](1087/1087.md), May 1991) -
The TOCED processor is used to conversationally edit the table of
contents of a program file. It allows all, or portions of the table
of contents to be edited, program elements to be deleted, and any
elements deleted after the last @PACK of the file to be recovered.
The TOCED command structure is modeled on the original @ED text
editor. All of the @ED commands have not been implemented, (INSERT,
APPEND, etc.) and some of the TOCED commands are unique (e.g., SAVE).
However, users familiar with @ED commands should find TOCED easy to
learn. (MSM, ABS)

**TPCERT** ([1065](1065/1065.md), April
1986<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - MASM program to
test tapes by writing a test pattern to the end of tape, rewinding,
and reading to the end. It solicits a reel number from the operator
and proceeds to that reel. At completion of processing for a reel,
the operator will be asked for another reel or END to stop. (ELT)

**TPF** ([1051](1051/1051.md), March
1983<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This processor

**TPUTIL** ([1084](1084/1084.md), December
1988<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Runstream
interface to the VALTAB/SKEL SSG skeleton used by the librarian to
effect changes to VALTAB entries. Starting or adding this runstream
causes the OPTION SGS to be set to C (for change) and will solicit
for the transaction names. (ABS)

**TRADES** ([1050](1050/1050.md), June
1984<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - The TRADES Model
is designed to perform transient load analysis by discrete event
simulation in an integrate devaluation system. It was designed to
simulate message processing by Sperry 1100/80 system but is fully
adaptable to simulate any other computer system.It is particularly
useful to predict performance under different dynamic loads.The input of messages into the model is scenario based creating an environment
similar to the user system. The model gives extensive tabular and
graphical outputs. It can simulate cache disk. There are a number of
programs in this package, but they all seem to be inter-related.

1993<i>![[OS 2200]](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - This MASM
processor waits a given number of milliseconds and then exits. It's
very useful when a batch job must wait a while to allow something
else to finish before continuing. (MSM, ABS)
