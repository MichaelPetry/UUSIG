TIDY renumbers, edits, and in general, tidys a FORTRAN source program
that has become unwieldy as a result of many revisions and patches.


The new, TIDY generated, version of the program is improved in
many ways. New statement numbers are assigned and incremented in the
main program and in each subroutine and internal function. Unneeded
statement numbers are eliminated. Statement number references are
updated. Only referenced FORMAT and CONTINUE statement are retained.
Embedded "@-comments" are removed from statements and reinserted as
comments preceding the statement. Blanks are deleted or inserted to
ensure uniformity.
