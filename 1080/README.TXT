                Mass Storage Archive / Retrieval System                     Version 3R1 - November, 1995     This is an unrestricted public domain release of the MARS software.  MARSis a collection of programs and runstreams that offers mass storage managementcapabilities that are much more extensive than the standard FAS archive.Level 1R1 of MARS was described in the May 1990 issue of UNISPHERE magazineand a presentation on level 2R1 was given at the Fall 1990 USE conference inSeattle.  Level 2R2 was presented at the Spring 1991 conference in Chicago.The paper that appears in the Conference Notes (pp. 611-643) provides ageneral technical overview of the software and should be reviewed before theinstallation process is started.  A brief non-technical overview and updatefor the latest level can be found in the November 1995 issue of UNISPHERE.     This release is being distributed on a standard 3.5" diskette.  Thediskette contains a copy of this document and one program (MARS3R1.EXE).Execute this program from a directory on your hard disk.  It will produce asingle text file (CATRUN).  Upload this file to your 1100/2200 system into anelement of the same name in any program file and @START it.  This is a self-extracting runstream which will produce the release file, MARS*RELEASE.  Itwill take only a few seconds to execute.  The runstream can be deleted afterthe release file has been created.  Additional documentation is supplied inMARS*RELEASE.  Use the following ECL to start a run that will print all of thedocumentation elements, and other helpful information:     >@START   MARS*RELEASE.RUN/DOCPRT     The output from this run will be about 100 pages and should be printed ona printer with lowercase capability.  There must be at least 57 printablelines/page (total less top and bottom margins).  If necessary, edit therunstream and add a margin control command to ensure proper operation.  Thefollowing documentation will be printed, in this order:DOC/INST-REF -   Complete step by step installation instructions.  Page one                 has a list of restrictions that should be reviewed to be                 sure none will affect operation at your site.DOC/UPDATE -     Migration instructions for level 2R2 to 3R1, and a list of                 enhancements.DOC/MHFS -       A supplement to the installation reference for those sites                 that wish to use the MHFS feature (shared history files).DOC/USER-REF -   The user reference manual for the MARS processor.DOC/ADMIN-REF -  The site administrator reference for the MARS processor.DOC/EXC-REPORT - Details of the Exception Report format.DOC/ACP -        Instructions for use of the ACP processor outside of the                 MARS environment.DOC/FETCH -      The user reference for the FETCH processor.DOC/FILES -      The user reference for the FILES processor.MGPDEF -         This PDP element contains the MARS global parameters.
