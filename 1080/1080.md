MARS provides a means of mass storage management that is much more
flexible and user-friendly than the standard FAS archive. Its major
advantages are: (1) user control of archive parameters by file, (2)
automatic expiration of archive tapes (expiration is file-dependent),
(3) interactive reload, and (4) batch reload processor. Interactive
reload of any file on a current FAS SAVE or SAVALL tape is also
available. Also provided with MARS is the Archive Copy Processor
(ACP), which can do disc-disc copies about four times as fast as
standard FURPUR, and disc-tape copies about twice as fast. MARS was
written up in the May 1990 and November 1995 issues of UNISPHERE
magazine and was presented at the Fall 1990 and Spring 1991 USE
conferences. This is the third UPLI release (3R1), which has several
new features including archive from removable packs and critical-file
backup. It is fully upward-compatible with the original release (2R1)
and has fewer restrictions. The MARS system is written entirely in
MASM and requires no local code. MARS is compatible with EXEC 41 and
requires SORT/MERGE.


MARS 3R1 has the following new features:


   
- <i>Multi-Host File Sharing (MHFS) capability</i>, which
       permits archive and retrieval of files from either STD or SHARED
       directories, or both.
    
       
- <i>Zero off-line expiration</i>, which allows files to be
       purged when the reference or cycle limits are met and a current
       backup exists.
    
       
- <i>Multipack capability</i>, for archive and retrieval of
       files that span more than one removable pack.
    
       
- Reload notification, which sends an optional message to a
       waiting demand user after the reload has completed.
    
       
- <i>The FILES processor</i>, which interrogates an existing
       database and provides a listing of all cataloged files having a
       specific qualifier and/or file name, with very fast response.
