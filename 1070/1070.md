<font color="#AF0000">GINFO</font> is a set of EXEC changes that
implement a new executive request (GINFO$) that gathers a variety of
performance statistics and makes them available to applications
programs via an executive request. GINFO$ provides information about
CPU usage, I/O accesses, executive request usage, cache disk
performance, memory usage, etc. It allows relatively easy
implementation of software tools that support real-time system
performance monitoring and which augment the monitoring software
supplied by Unisys. Three programs are included that use the GINFO$
ER to display performance information on a CRT. FWHAT displays
summary statistics for the entire system and shows the relative
amount of CPU time and I/O accesses being used by each run. ERMON
displays information about a user-specified ER, showing the number of
times each run in the system is calling that ER each second. FACTS
displays detailed information about up to 10 activities in one or
more runs.
