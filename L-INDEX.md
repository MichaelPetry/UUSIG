- - -
<b>L</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), June 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program controls and simplifies the
processes of source program checkout, compilation, testing, turnover,
and production implementation of those programs. See LCR for more
information.(ABS)


<b>LABELDUMP</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), April
1982![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - The @LABELDUMP program dumps the labels of
ANSI-labeled tapes. (MSM, ABS)


<b>LCompare 1.5 </b>([1103](1103/INDEX.md) April
1996![](IMAGES/LINC.JPG)) - LCompare compares Unisys' LDAIII / LINC model
extract and case extract files. (LDA)


<b>LCR</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), June 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Librarian Control Routine. Acts like TIMER in
that it oversees and controls access to the librarian database. The
librarian database contains information on all of the production
programs as far as what type of program it is (TIP, batch, etc.), who
is making changes,whether it is being tested, etc. See L for more
information.(ABS)


<b>LEFT</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the MVS/ISPF LEFT command.(IPF)


<b>LEN</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the CTS LEN command.(IPF)


<b>LENGTH</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the CTS LENGTH command. (IPF)


LETRS ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), August 1980![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Yet another block letter program. (MSM, ABS)


<b>LIB</b> ([1051](1051/INDEX.md), April
1977![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available. (ASM, ABS)


<b>LINE</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Puts your terminal in line mode.(IPF)


<b>LINK</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - An @MAP collector-caller.(IPF)


<b>LISP</b> ([1032](1032/INDEX.md), March
1979![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - LISP is a programming language designed
primarily for processing symbolic data. It has been used for symbolic
calculations in differential and integral calculus, electrical
circuit theory, mathematical logic, game playing and other fields of
artificial intelligence. Documentation included. (ASM, ABS)


<b>LIST</b> ([1097](1097/INDEX.md), March
1993![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Produces a symbolic element listing with Base
level line numbers, Correction images, PCF-relative line numbers, and
Source Output line numbers. Spec 1 can be either a program file
element or a data file. Documentation included. (ABS)


<b>LISTFILES</b> ([1051](1067/INDEX.md), August
1980![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Program description not available.(ABS)


<b>LM</b> ([1072](1072/INDEX.md), May 1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Change to line mode. (IPF)


<b>LOAD</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), December
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This processor loads a file from it's tape
backup. For non-S-option processing, a run called RSTOR is started to
accomplish the actual loading of the file's text. RSTOR is started
immediately after the archive file(s) are read and the location of
the file is determined. If the Z option is used, the starting of
RSTOR is delayed until another @LOAD is done or 1 minute passes,
whichever occurs first. (MSM, ABS)


<b>LOCATE</b> ([1084](1084/INDEX.md), September
1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - A program to search all program files in the
system for the specified element. (ABS)


<b>LOF</b> ([1051](1072/INDEX.md), May 1988![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Short form of LOGOFF. (IPF)


<b>LOGDUMP</b> 2R1 ([1037](1037/INDEX.md), March
1980![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - This program will allow selective
printing/dumping of entries in the system log or log tape.
Documentation included. (ELT, ABS)


<b>LOOK</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like, ""OLD filename,LOOKSPACE"". (IPF)


<b>LOOKPRINT$</b> ([1091](1091/INDEX.md),
October 1991![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)![[MAPPER]](IMAGES/MAPPER.JPG))
- On the 1100/2200 systems, printouts are generated when processing
runstreams. These printouts, called PRINT$ files, consume much paper
and require handling by humans. Frederick and Nelson developed
LOOKPRINT$, a MAPPER based application for providing on-line access
and processing of PRINT$ files. Frederick and Nelson has reported
many benefits from this system, including the elimination of millions
of pages of paper, immediate access to the PRINT$ upon completion of
a runstream, remote access for programmers who are "on call," and
automatic extraction of information from PRINT$ files. LOOKPRINT$ is
compatible with MAPPER 35R1 or higher. Documentation included. (RIDS)


<b>LOWERCASE</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May
1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the VM/XEDIT LOWERCASE command.
(IPF)


<b>LS</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.md), May 1990![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Works like the UNIX ls command.(IPF)


<b>LSC</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.md), January
1992![](IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)) - Editor macro used to print a scale (up to
column 71, positioned to line up with LNPRINT output). (ELT)
