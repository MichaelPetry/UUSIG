<font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> is a fast, powerful SDF file
processor, written by Ward Condit who won the 1990 UPLI Contribution
Award with MARS ([1080](../1080/INDEX.HTM)), that replaces
and enhances most of the functions of @ED,R and can outperform it by
a factor of ten or more. Version 2R1A is an update to 2R1 and is
fully upward compatible. Approximately 10,000 tracks per minute can
be processed on an 1100/90 with 8470 discs. In addition to its speed,
<font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> features: an internal line index
that allows almost instant access to any record that has been read
before; large record support (up to 2047 <b><i>words</i></b>); low
intensity/reverse video display of control character sequences so
they can be observed without screen corruption; and ability to
extract and reformat fixed portions of data records, including
numerical representation of computational fields; ability to
preselect a subset of records based on fixed field contents prior to
display, locate, extract functions. It incorporates FUSION simulated
full-screen processing from CAA (available separately from UUSIG,
catalog [1081](../1081/INDEX.HTM), for use with other
software, such as Unisys' @ED processor).


Release 2R1 has several significant enhancements. It has the
ability to process a raw ASCII log as if it was SDF formatted. Each
record is edited into a compressed standard format that includes the
most commonly used information. The "find address" commands make it
easy to locate data in a PMD-format dump, and REFORMAT has some new
capabilities. Release 2R1A provides improvements which have been made
in the areas of data extraction and record selection. @ED-compatible
changes to support column limits for LOCATE have been made. Full
source code is included with this release.


Release 3R1 allows you to save and restore symbol definitions
across sessions. Output files and elements can now be sorted before
being written. There are new commands (IF, ELSE and IFEND) which
allow selective execution depending on the "find" or "no find" status
from the last LOCATE or FIND. Two new field types have been defined
(unsigned and signed packed numeric) which operate the same as the
original &lt;UC&gt; and &lt;SC&gt; except that leading zeros are
omitted. And level 3R1 has a built-in HELP facility.


Also distributed with <font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> is an
updated @BK2 processor. It includes a Z option which invokes the
<font color="#AF0000">ZIP</font> processor instead of Unisys' @ED
editor.
