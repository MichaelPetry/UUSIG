<b>X</b> ([1081](1081/INDEX.HTM), April 1992 <i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Editor macro used to do an
"EXIT" for people with fumble fingers. (ELT)</center>


<b>XCTS</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990
<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Works like the CTS XCTS
command.(IPF)


<b>XEDIT/FUNCTIONKEYS</b>
([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990 <i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Sets up your function keys
like VM/XEDIT. (IPF)


<b>XIPF</b> ([1077](1077/INDEX.HTM), May 1990
<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - Gets you out of IPF. Same as
the LOGOFF command. (IPF)


<b>XREAD</b> ([1067](1067/INDEX.HTM), June 1983
<i>![[OS 2200]](../IMAGES/OS2200.JPG)</i>) - XREAD is a tape read
subroutine bypassing system error recovery. This FORTRAN-callable
subroutine tries to read any tape, regardless of parity errors, bad
spots, noise, abnormal frame counts,etc. By using suppress recovery
mode to read tapes, XREAD bypasses the normal system recovery
mechanisms in case of tape errors. Because of this fact, XREAD should
not be used as a substitute for such routines as NTRAN, which do not
bypass system recovery. XREAD should only be used if the input tape
is of unknown density or parity, or contains many permanent errors
which normal system recovery is unable to get around. Documentation
included. (ASM, REL)
