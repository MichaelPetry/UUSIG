TRACE is a diagnostic routine for EXEC-8 assembly language. The
element TRACE should be mapped with the R option. SLJ TRACE starts
the routine. SLJ NTRACE ends the routine. SLJ ITRACE, followed by +n
(where n is the relative address of the SLJ ITRACE) sets up values
for relative addresses in the output form, rather than absolute
addresses.
